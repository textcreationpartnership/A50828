            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Liberty I take to offer You this Work is not out of Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. It is a Debt I come to pay, an Homage I come to render to Your ROYAL HIGHNESS. 'Tis Your R.H. has occaſion'd it, upon the News of your happy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Princeſs. Which
<pb facs="tcp:30793:3"/>has diffuſed ſo great a Joy through the whole Nation, that it had certainly broke out into Extraordinary and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Demonſtrations, at any other Conjuncture. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it has created a Deſire to know the eſtate of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which has given us ſo Illuſtrious a Prince by his Birth, ſo famous for his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſo Amiable by that Sweetneſs of Diſpoſition which has already gained him ſo many Hearts in this Realm. Therefore, to ſatisfy the Publick, I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this ſhort Deſcription of the State of Denmark; in
<pb facs="tcp:30793:3"/>writing of which, I had the advantage of ſpeaking well of Denmark, without having need to flatter. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, it will be ſo much the more Acceptable to Your ROYAL HIGHNESS, and the Publick. If it ſhall have the Fortune to pleaſe, 'twill be no ſmall Satisfaction to me, and I ſhould think my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to have done Something that had the Honour to be approved by ſo great a Prince. For whom my Prayers to Heaven ſhall be, to pour down its moſt benign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences upon Your ROYAL HIGHNESS, to crown your
<pb facs="tcp:30793:4"/>Marriage with a glorious Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, that this happy Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may prove an eternal Bond of Amity between the two Kingdoms of England and Denmark, and that Your ROYAL HIGHNESS may all the days of your Life be the Delight of your Friends and Terrour of your Enemies. I humbly beg of Y. R. H. to accept of theſe Marks of the Zeal I have for your Service, and to believe that none can be with more Veneration than I am</p>

            <p>HERE you have a Short, but Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, Deſcription of the State of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, which may be called <hi>Multum in Parvo.</hi> The Occaſion for Writing of it is eaſy to gueſs at. Before the late Marriage of GEORGE, Prince of Denmark, with the Lady <hi>ANN,</hi> the Engliſh had no other Intereſt in that Countrey but that of a Northern Trade. And the Truth is, few People minded it, but ſuch as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Way. But now theſe two Crowns are come to a cloſer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, 'tis worth our while to look back, and to conſider the State of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, wherein the Engliſh Nation has ſo great an Interest in the Prince's Perſon. A Monarchy which has been in former times moſt formidable both to France and England; and which has to this day the Command of the Baltick, in a far better manner than the Venetians can pretend it of their Gulf. A Monarchy of great Latitude, if we conſider all the acceſſory Eſtates to the Crown of Denmark, as the Kingdom of <hi>Norway,</hi> with the Iſles of <hi>Schetland, Feroe,</hi> and <hi>Iſeland;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Coaſt of <hi>Groenland</hi> in <hi>Terra Polaris Arctica,</hi> and <hi>New-Denmark</hi> in the Northern America. In Germany, Weſt of the Dutchy of Bremen, the King of Denmark has got of late years the fruitful Counties of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt.</hi> In Africk he has <hi>Frederixburg,</hi> upon the Coaſt of Guinea; beſides ſome Holds in
<pb facs="tcp:30793:5"/>Aſia. As for the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> it ſelf, which is the main Thing of all, I have had the advantage of knowing the Country; not only by reading Authors upon that Subject, but alſo by my own Experience, when I was there an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on the Right Honourable the Earl of Carliſle in his Northern Embaſſy's. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Changes have hapned there ſince, I got out of my Memoires. So that you have really, in this ſmall Tract, the State of <hi>Denmark</hi> both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern. Wherein you will find not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Geography, but a great deal of Hiſtory both Civil and Natural.</p>

               <hi>POSTSCRIPT.</hi> Upon the finiſhing of this Book at the Preſs, I was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee another get the ſtart of it; being of this very ſize, upon the ſame Subject, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Title. The Style whereof might have been more polite, the Matter better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, the Impreſſion much neater, and the Faults leſs numerous, had not the Book (as I am informed) been hurry'd into the World, for the preventing of This. But ſome People will run, though they make more Haſte than good Speed.</p>

            <head>THE PRESENT STATE OF DENMARK.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>A Prefatory Diſcourſe of the Riſe and Progreſs of this Monarchy.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE State of Denmark, the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I take in hand, has been in former Ages a great and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State. <hi>Gotricus,</hi> or <hi>Godfrey,</hi> was the firſt King of Note that took upon him the Daniſh Government. Which hapned in the Year of our Lord 797. And 'twas about this time that the Danes firſt began to infeſt the Coaſts of England, that they invaded Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with a Fleet of 200 Sail, and would have indangered the great Monarchy of France, if the Death of Godfrey, and the Quarrels that aroſe about the Succeſſion after his Deceaſe, had not kept them off.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30793:6"/>
            <p>At laſt, their Affairs at home being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again, they employ'd their whole Forces againſt England, as the weaker Enemy. This hapned in the beginning of the ninth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is, in the time of Egbert, the laſt King of the Weſt-Saxons, and the firſt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Which being now reduced from a State of Heptarchy into that of a Monarchy, was unhappily diſturbed by theſe new Gueſts. Who, having filled up the void Rooms of the Juites and Angles in Jutland, (formerly called the Cimbrick Cherſoneſe) thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to follow them into Britain alſo. So that, next to the Saxons, the Danes were the moſt conſiderable Actors in the Stage of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Where they continued about 225 years, during which time they firſt erected many ſmall Sovereignties. Till, after ſeveral Checks given them by King Alfred, his Son Edward, and Athelſtan Edward's Son, they were at laſt brought by King Edred under the Engliſh Government, and compelled by him to be chriſtened. So that they lived with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, mixed in Marriages and Alliance, and incorporated with them.</p>
            <p>But, toward the latter end of the tenth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, in the Reign of King Ethelred, a weak Prince, the Danes began again to grow upon the Engliſh. Inſomuch that the King was ſain to buy his Peace of them at the yearly Tribute of ten thouſand Pounds, inhanced
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30793:6"/>ſoon after to forty thouſand. A vaſt Sum in thoſe Times, which was raiſed upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by the name of <hi>Danegelt.</hi> Till at laſt King Ethelred, weary of theſe Exactions, and willing to ſhake them off, plotted with his Subjects to kill all the Danes, as they ſlept in their Beds. Which Plot took effect, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to expectation, on St. Brice's night, Nov. 12. <hi>Anno</hi> 1012.</p>
            <p>Sueno was then King of Denmark, to which Crown he added Norway by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. He, being a right Valiant Prince, heard no ſooner of the Nocturnal Exploit of the Engliſh, but he prepared a mighty Fleet, in order to revenge ſo great an Outrage and Diſhonour done to his Nation. He came over himſelf with his Fleet unto England, and the dreadful noiſe of his Approach compelled King Ethelred to fly. Away he goes into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, leaving his poor Subjects to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a cruel Invader, who breathed nothing but Revenge.</p>
            <p>The Danes, having thus, by the Valour and good fortune of Sueno their King, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Power in England, obtained at laſt the Kingdom, in the Perſon of his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Son Canute. A Temperate Prince, and who did really deſerve the Title of Great. Beſides the Crown of England, he got the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway upon the Deceaſe of his Brother Olaus, and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30793:7"/>that of Sweden. Thus he was King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.</p>
            <p>But, unhappily for his Poſterity, he opened a way to their Excluſion from the Crown of England, when he ſent back his Daniſh Forces into their Country. A very Impolitick Act, as if a Kingdom got by Force could be held by Favour.</p>
            <p>'Tis true he reigned twenty Years, and at his Death left the Crown of England to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold his baſe Son. But then the Danes Intereſt here grew ſo weak, that in leſs than ſeven years this Crown returned to the Saxon Line.</p>
            <p>For King Harold reigned but four years, and died without Iſſue. To whom ſucceeded his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hardy Canute, King of Denmark, who reigned here but about two Years, and was the laſt King of the Daniſh Race in England.</p>
            <p>Thus the Danes had here in all but three Kings of their Nation; <hi>viz.</hi> Canute the Great, and his two Sons Harold and Hardy Canute, who reigned here all three but about 26 years.</p>
            <p>To Hardy Canute ſucceeded his half Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edward, ſurnamed the Confeſſor, the ſeventh Son of Ethelred by Emma his Queen, Goodwine Earl of Kent being the main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in ſetting him up. The Saxon Line being thus re-inthroned, we muſt now follow the Danes into Denmark, and take a view of their Tranſactions in the North.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30793:7"/>
            <p>Canute the Second aforeſaid had a Siſters Son called Sueno, who was his next Succeſſor but one in Denmark. This Sueno reſtored the Kingdom of Norway to the Norvegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>But it was again united to Denmark in the Reign of Aquin King of Norway, by his Marriage with Margaret, Daughter of Walde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar the Third, King of Denmark; that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred Years ago. In which State it has continued ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Aquin being dead, his Widow, Queen Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet, took up the Reins of the Government. And, not being contented with two Crowns, ſhe ventured them to get that of Sweden, as a Crown that had gone away from her Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and that by courſe ſhould have fallen to the ſhare of her Husband.</p>
            <p>Albert of Mecklemburg was then King of Sweden. This Semiramis of the North chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges him as an Uſurper, raiſes an Army againſt him, fights him, routs his Army, and takes the King Priſoner. So that Albert was fain to reſign his Crown to Margaret as her due.</p>
            <p>This brave Queen, having thus united the three Kingdoms under her Command, cauſed an Act of State to be paſſed in Calmar, one of the chief Towns in Sweden, for the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of this Union unto her Succeſſors, the Law and Privileges of each Kingdom conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing as before they were.</p>

            <p>Her immediate Succeſſor was Eric Duke of Pomeren, her own Siſters Son. Him ſhe adopted for her next Heir, and he was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly choſen in her life time King of the three Kingdoms, into which he ſucceeded actually after her Deceaſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1422. Having reigned about 27 years, he reſigned his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>Anno</hi> 1439.</p>
            <p>This Reſignation was followed by an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, which laſted ſix years. At laſt, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1445, Chriſtopher, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and Nephew of Eric (being the Son of Margaret, his Siſter) was choſen by the joynt Conſent of all the States of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. He reigned but three years, and died without Iſſue. Whereupon the Swedes grown weary of the Daniſh Government, broke the foreſaid Agreement made at Calmar, and choſe a King of their own.</p>
            <p>The Danes on the other ſide, conſidering the great Advantage they had got by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Norway, pitched upon Adolph Duke of Sleſwick and Earl of Holſtein, for the next Succeſſor; that they might get in thoſe Eſtates to their Kingdoms. But he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by reaſon of his Age and want of Children, and commended to them Chriſtiern Earl of Oldenburg, his Nephew and next Heir, who was accordingly choſen, <hi>An.</hi> 1448. Adolph dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome years after, King Chriſtiern ſucceeded him in the Eſtates of Holſtein and Sleſwick,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30793:8"/>continuing ever ſince united unto that Crown. And from this Chriſtiern the Succeſſion was hitherto continued in his Line.</p>
            <p>As for the Crown of Sweden, 'tis true the Danes recovered it in the time of the ſaid Chriſtiern. For Charles Canute King of Sweden, whom the Swedes had choſen on the Death of Chriſtopher King of Denmark and Sweden, being upon diſcontent fled to Dantzick where he ended his days, Chriſtiern was called in by a Party of the Swedes, and crowned King of Sweden. But he was outed again, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that he had not kept Conditions with them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtiern dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1482. his Son John ſucceeded him; and the Swedes, then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by the Moſcovites, received him as their King. But, their turn being ſerved, they expelled him alſo.</p>
            <p>To John ſucceeded <hi>Anno</hi> 1513. his Son Chriſtiern the Second, the Nero of the North, who recovered once more the Crown of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But he uſed his Subjects ſo inſolently at home, and his Victory in Sweden ſo cruelly, that he was driven out of Denmark by his Uncle Frederick, and out of Sweden by Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtave Eric, deſcended from the ancient Kings of Sweden.</p>
            <p>Thus the Danes recovered no leſs than three times the Crown of Sweden, till they were utterly diſpoſſeſſed of it by the foreſaid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30793:9"/>Eric, <hi>Anno</hi> 1523; in whoſe Houſe it has conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever ſince.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the Viciſſitude of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that, whereas in former Ages the Crown of Sweden was ſubject to Denmark, in this our Age that of Denmark was twice reduced to ſuch ſtraits by the Swedes, that the whole Kingdom of Denmark was in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the Walls of Copenhagen, and then in the greateſt Diſtreſs imaginable. All which hapned within the compaſs of four years, <hi>viz.</hi> in the years 1657. 1658. 1659. 1660, under the late Reigns of Charles the Ninth King of Sweden, and of Frederic the Third, King of Denmark The Hiſtory of which Wars you will find accurately written by Sir Roger Manley. A prodigious Hiſtory, and ſcarce to be parallelled by any. Where you will find thoſe two Kings fighting hand to hand for no leſs than a Crown, the King of Sweden with a wonderful Reſolution and continued Succeſſes, the King of Denmark with an undaunted Courage and indefatigable Indeavours to beat back ſo ſwift an Invader, and ſtop him in his Career.</p>
            <p>Whereupon a Treaty, by the Mediation of England, was concluded at Roſchild, in the Month of February 1658. By which Treaty the King of Sweden was to reſtore the Places he had taken from the Danes, and were then poſſeſſed by him. And the King of Denmark,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30793:9"/>in conſideration of the ſaid Reſtitution, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for a Recompence of the Damages cauſed by this War, did give and grant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Sweden, and his Heirs for ever, the Country of Schonen, with the incorporate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Halland and Bleking; beſides the Iſland of Bornholm, together with the Caſtles, Towns, and Territories of Bahuys and Dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim in Norway, the Secular and Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction which the King of Denmark had over ſome Places in the Iſle of Rugen, and all Places whatſoever taken from the Swedes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this War. Thoſe were Bremerford, a good place in the Dutchy of Bremen; the Bellemore Sconce, lying upon the Elb; and the Leher Sconce, commanding the Weſer. The taking of which, whilſt the Swedes were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged in Poland, was the Occaſion of this unhappy War to the Crown of Denmark.</p>
            <p>To which I ſhall only add this material Article granted by King Frederick to King Charles by the ſaid Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Ships whatſoever in the Sound and Belt are by virtue of the ſaid Treaty to be free and exempted from all Cuſtoms, Inquiſitions, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, Arreſt, or any other Moleſtation whatſoever, producing only a right Sea-paſs in the King of Denmarks Cuſtom-Houſes of Elſineur and Newburg.</p>
            <p>By this Treaty 'tis plain that King Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick was a great Loſer, and yet a great Saver,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30793:10"/>conſidering the deſperate Poſture of his Affairs in that Juncture of time, His Crown was clipped, but ſtill he had a Crown. And 'tis obſervable, that the two Kings upon this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had a friendly Interview, with plain dealing, and little or nothing of Royal Formality. The Relation of which I ſhall have occaſion to give you in another Place.</p>
            <p>And yet ſoon after this the War broke out again. For King Charles, pretending that King Frederick had not performed his Articles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a ſecond Invaſion upon Denmark; and did it with ſo much Prudence and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, that (whilſt ſome thought him gone towards Pruſſia, others towards Pomeren, but none towards Denmark) he came from Wiſmar to Oldeſlo, then to Kiel in Holſtein, from thence by Sea to Corſoer in Seland, and ſo ſtraight before Copenhagen, in Auguſt 1658.</p>
            <p>My Deſign is not to give you the particulars of this famous Siege, which is already ſo well done in the forementioned Hiſtory. Only I ſhall tell you in general, that the Pate of Denmark depended now (if ever) on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage and Conduct of King Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick. Who, upon the ſight of theſe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Invaders, being prompted to make a timely Retreat into Norway or Holland, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with a Royal Magnanimity, that he would live and die in his Neſt, and not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Fate and Glory of his Country.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30793:10"/>
            <p>In ſhort, this War continued as long as King Charles lived. And, though a Treaty was on foot to be influenced by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sea-Forces of England and Holland; yet the Buſineſs was ſo carried on, that no Treaty was made till after the Death of King Charles. Who dying in the Year 1660. of a malignant Fever, at Gottenburg in Sweden, left his Crown and Conqueſts to Charles his Son, the preſent King of Sweden.</p>
            <p>Soon after his Death, the Treaty of Peace was concluded, much upon the Baſis of the Roſchild Treaty. But the Government of Drontheim in Norway was by this Treaty reſtored to King Frederick. Who died Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary the 9th. in the Year 1670, being 61 years old.</p>
            <p>Since that time there has been another Rupture betwixt theſe two Northen Crowns, in the late Wars which have imbrued Europe in ſo much Blood. Where both the preſent King of Denmark Chriſtiern V. and the Illuſtrious Prince George his only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have given ſuch proofs of their Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Valor as becomes the Royal Iſſue of ſo magnanimous a Prince as King Frederick. 'Twas in this War, that the Swedes were routed out of Germany. Pomeren they loſt to the Elector of Brandenburg, Wiſmar in Mecklemburg and ſeveral Places in Schonen to the King of Denmark. Where the Danes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30793:11"/>them frequently in Field-Fights and in Sieges, neither did they come off leſs triumphantly at Sea. And, though the moſt Chriſtian King forced the Danes at laſt, as well as Brandenburg, to a Reſtitution; yet they had the ſatisfaction of having revenged in ſome meaſure their former Quarrel with the Swedes. So true it is, that of all humane Things, none is more ſubject to Viciſſitude than the Iſſues of War.</p>
            <p>Thus having brought this Monarchy from the firſt Riſe thereof to its preſent State, through a continued Series of the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Changes; I ſhall now, with all the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and brevity I can, proſecute my main Deſign. In order to which I muſt in the firſt place give an Account of Denmark, then of Norway, and laſtly of ſome other Eſtates and Dominions belonging to this Crown.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of <hi>DENMARK,</hi> in general.</head>
               <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>DENMARK</hi> lies Eaſt from Scotland and the North of England, at leaſt 300 miles by Sea the neareſt Parts. The ſame is called <hi>Denmark,</hi> or <hi>Danemark, i. e.</hi> the Country of the <hi>Danes,</hi> whoſe Original you ſhall hear of afterwards.</p>
               <p>The beſt and greateſt Part of it is the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſule called <hi>Jutland,</hi> otherwiſe the Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick Cherſoneſe from its ancient Name <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brica
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30793:11"/>Cherſoneſus.</hi> The reſt does conſiſt of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, the principal of which are <hi>Seland</hi> and <hi>Funen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Country of <hi>Schonen,</hi> formerly part of Denmark; 'twas by the Roſchild Treaty transferred to the Crown of Sweden, and incorporated with it. So that it does not belong to my Subject.</p>
               <p>The whole Country is almoſt ſurrounded with the Sea, nothing but the South Parts of the Peninſule bordering upon any Land. The Peninſule lies Weſtward, and the Iſlands Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Ocean goes round about that, as far as the little Belt, which parts it from Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. Situate it is betwixt the fifty fourth and fifty ninth Degrees of Northern Latitude, and conſequently altogether in the Northern Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Zone; the Skau, or Skagen (which is the moſt Northern Point of Denmark) being no leſs than eight Degrees and a half diſtant from the Arctick Circle, where begins the Frigid Zone. Accordingly there the longeſt day is ſomewhat above 18 hours; and at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena, near Hamburg in the South Parts of the Cherſoneſe, not quite 17. In ſhort, this Country lies parallel to all that Tract of Ground which is from Hull in Yorkſhire to Dornock in the furtheſt Parts of Scotland. At 20 Leagues, or 60 miles a Degree, the whole Length in a direct Line comes to about 80 Leagues, or 240 miles.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30793:12"/>
               <p>As the Ocean parts Denmark from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland, ſo the Baltick parts it from Sweden. This is the <hi>Sinus Codanus</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, otherwiſe called <hi>Mare Suevicum,</hi> and now <hi>Mare Balticum,</hi> from the name of Baltick, whereby we now call it. The Dutch call it <hi>Die Belt,</hi> or elſe <hi>Oost Zee,</hi> that is the Eaſt-Sea.</p>
               <p>There are three ſeveral Paſſages into it from the Ocean, all of them under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King of Denmark. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſafeſt, and moſt uſual Paſſage is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Streight called the <hi>Sound,</hi> betwixt the Eaſt parts of Seland and the Weſt of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen in Swethland. Which is ſo great a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that there comes often 200, ſometimes 300 Sail of Ships, in one day. The ſame is hardly four miles over, where it is narroweſt. The ſecond Paſſage, or Inlet, lyes Weſt of that, betwixt the Iſles of Seland and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. This is ſome ſixteen miles over, from Korſoer to Newburg. And it is called <hi>Belt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> or the <hi>Great Belt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Middlefare</hi> (or the leſſer) <hi>Belt.</hi> Which is the moſt Weſtern and narroweſt Paſſage, lying betwixt Funen and Jutland, not above two miles over.</p>
               <p>From theſe three Streights, lying Eaſt and Weſt, the Baltick Sea widens it ſelf, and runs a good way Eaſt-Northward, till it divides it ſelf into two long Gulfs, one running North, and the other Eaſt. The firſt of which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30793:12"/>
                  <hi>Bothn-Zee,</hi> or the Gulf of <hi>Bothnia,</hi> from a Province of that name in Sweden; and the other <hi>Finnich-Zee,</hi> or <hi>Finland</hi>-Gulf, from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Province of that Name belonging like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Sweden, which Province ſeparates thoſe Gulfs from one another.</p>
               <p>Northward, this Sea runs all along Sweden. Southward it waſhes part of Denmark, the North Parts of Mecklemburg and Pomeren in Germany, Curland in Poland, Livonia and Ingria both belonging to Sweden. So that it may be called the Mediterranean of the North. This Sea has no viſible Tide, and ſwarms in many Places (eſpecially towards the Sea Coaſts) with Iſlets, Shelves, and Rocks, which make the Navigation in thoſe Parts very hazardous. Moſt commonly in Winter-time 'tis ſo fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen up, that the Ships are Ice-bound in their Harbours.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of January, <hi>Anno</hi> 1658, the Cold was ſo intenſe, and ſo very violent beyond the memory of Man, that the Sea became a ſolid Bridge of Ice. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that King Charles of Sweden, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as a ſingular Providence that made way to his Greatneſs, reſolved to march out of Jutland into Funen over the Frozen Sea, againſt the ſenſe of his chief Officers. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, but yet ſucceſsful Attempt.</p>
               <p>Not a Night paſſed, ſaith my Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, wherein he did not ſend his Spies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſland, and his Scouts to diſcover
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30793:13"/>the firmneſs of the Waters.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the late Wars in Denm. p. 6.</note> Which being at length reported to be ſtrong enough, ſave only a ſmall but long Rent of ſcarce five Foot broad, he gave orders to March. But firſt he commanded a great quantity of Planks, Poſts, Hurds, and the like Materials to be brought thither and laid, to make a Bridge over the ſaid Breach. The Ice breaking, two Troops of Waldecks Regiment fell in, and ſeveral other ſingle Troopers were drowned. Which forced the Army to ruſh on with more vigour, being too far ingaged to retire, and the Danger behind them being greater than that in their Front. In ſhort, they got to Funen, the Inhabitants whereof being thus ſtrangely ſurpriſed made little or no Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>This great Succeſs of King Charles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him for a ſecond March over Sea, and the very ſight of the Ice inflamed his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. To Seland he muſt go to ſurpriſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen. And, though the neareſt Way was over the great Belt, the Iſland Spro beſides lying about half way; yet he thought fit to take another Courſe. He went from Funen to Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſo through Laland and Falſter to Seland. By which means he ſecured all thoſe Iſlands in his way, and ſurpriſed Seland at Warimburg, where no body dreamt of his Coming. From Warimburg, with an Army
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30793:13"/>not conſiſting of above 7000. Horſe and Foot, he made haſt towards Copenhagen. Where I leave him, to proceed in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>By what is ſaid, you may gueſs of the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Air</hi> in Denmark. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being but narrow, and the ſeveral Parts of it ſevered from one another by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Sea, you cannot expect to hear of any great <hi>Rivers.</hi> The chief of them you may have an account of in the particular Deſcriptions we ſhall make. <hi>Mountains</hi> of any note I cannot find, in a Country for the part moſt plain, and little ſwell'd with Mountains. In North-Jutland indeed there is a very high Mountain called <hi>Alberg,</hi> in which (as the Inhabitants believe, and report accordingly) are found ſome Marks and Remainders of the ancient Giants.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Denmark in general is a wholſom, brave, and fertile Country. It produces great plenty of Corn, and has ſuch Paſture-Grounds for the feeding of Oxen, that (according to divers Authors) there are ſent every year from hence into Germany above fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Oxen. On the other ſide, the green Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Woods feed innumerable Herds of Swine; where they eat their fill of Maſt and Acorns, falling from the great Oaks and Beech-trees in abundance. But, beſides this vile ſort of Cattel, here is likewiſe a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30793:14"/>number of Horſes and wild Deer, and eſpecially Stags and Elks. Fiſh cannot be wanted in a Country ſufficiently irrigated with Rivers, and ſo ſurrounded as it is with the Sea. But it is obſervable that in South-Jutland the Fields there do interchangeably yield both Fiſh and Corn. For once in three or four years the Natives let the Pools over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the Land, for the Fiſh to eat up the Graſs, and the Mud which is left behind to inrich the Soil. And then you may think they catch plenty of Fiſh.</p>

               <p>At this time <hi>Jutland</hi> is divided into North and South Jutland. The firſt is ſubdivided into the four Dioceſes (or Diſtricts) of <hi>Alburg, Wiburg, Arhuſen,</hi> and <hi>Ripen;</hi> and South-Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, into the Dukedoms of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein.</hi>

               <p>The Dioceſe of <hi>Alburg</hi> takes up the moſt Northern Parts of this Peninſule, and is ſo called from <hi>Alburg</hi> the chief Place hereof; ſeated on the South-ſide of the Bay of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> that Bay which opening Eaſtward croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es almoſt all the Peninſule, and makes in its way a good large Iſland called <hi>Mors.</hi> On the Weſt of which Iſland is the Tract of Land call'd the <hi>Ty,</hi> or <hi>Tyland,</hi> as thoſe Parts which lye North of the ſaid Bay go by the name of <hi>Winſiſſel.</hi>

               <p>The Dioceſe of <hi>Wiburg</hi> lies South of that; and is ſo called from <hi>Wiburg,</hi> the Epiſcopal See, ſituate on a River which runs North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the Bay of Limfort.</p>
               <p>South of that lies the Diſtrict of <hi>Arhuſen,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Arhuſen,</hi> the chief place here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Situate Eaſt-Southward from Wiburg by the Sea ſide, and being a Port of good note, few miles above the leſſer Belt. Oppoſite to which is <hi>Rinkoping</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of the Peninſule, thirteen Leagues diſtant from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſen Weſtward, and ten from Ripen North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This is a noted Sea Port on the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ocean.</p>
               <p>The Dioceſe of <hi>Ripen</hi> is the moſt Southern, and the largeſt of all. The ſame is ſo deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from <hi>Ripen,</hi> the Epiſcopal See, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Weſt-ſide of the Peninſule, near the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, and fortified with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Under this Dioceſe there are no leſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30793:15"/>than thirty Herets or Perfectures, 282 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, ſeven walled Towns, and ten Royal Caſtles.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe Towns I cannot but take a particular notice of <hi>Fredericks-Ode.</hi> The taking of which by the Swedes (Nov. 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 1657.) under the Conduct of Marſhal Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, did not only give them the Plunder and Contribution of moſt part of Jutland, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo traced them the way for their further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. This was a new Town, ſeated on the leſſer Belt, indowed with many Priviledges to invite Inhabitants, and fortified on the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. The Sea-ſide, being palliſadoed from the adjoyning Bulwarks as ſar as deep Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was counted ſtrong enough. But the Swedes, under favour of the Darkneſs, and ſome falſe Alarms, broke down that wooden Fence; and, ruſhing in up to the Saddle-skirts in Water, took the Town by Storm. Where, beſides 2000 ſlain, they made above 2000 Priſoners, whereof near 200 Officers. There they found no leſs than 33 Colours, and 80 Pieces of Canon, with other Store of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Plunder.</p>
               <p>But the Swedes kept it little above a twelve Month in their hands. For, about the latter end of the following Year, the Emperour, the King of Poland, and the Elector of Brandenburg, being confederated together againſt the Swedes, in their own and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30793:15"/>Danes behalf, they put the Swediſh Forces in Jutland ſo hard to it, that they were fain to quit all their Holds there. Upon their quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Place the Confederates reſolved, but in vain, to purſue the Swedes into the Iſle of Funen. Where they were ſo warmly received by the Defendants, that they were fain to retire before they could reach the ſhore. Here is alſo in this Dioceſe the Sea-Port of <hi>Colding,</hi> not above ſix miles South-weſt of Fredericks-Ode. The ſame is fortified with a Caſtle, called Arnsburg; and here is paid the Toll for the Horſes and Oxen which paſs this way for Holſtein and Germany. This Town was taken from the Swedes, ſome time before Fredericks-Ode, by Czernesky, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Poliſh Forces. Having forced the Kings Palace, he put the whole Garriſon to the Sword, reſerving only the Governour and his Lieutenant to publiſh his Victory and their own Misfortune.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to South-Jutland, which (as I ſaid before) comprehends the Dukedoms of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein.</hi> Though there are thoſe, I confeſs, who look upon Holſtein as no part (or Member) of Jutland, but as a Country of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ſo called from <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> the chief Place of it. Seated towards the end of a large Bay or Inlet of the Baltick, which runs half way the Peninſule Weſtward, and gives
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30793:16"/>to Sleſwick a fair and commodious Haven. The Dukedom was firſt erected by King Eric of Denmark, who gave it to Waldemar, great Grandchild of Abel a former King, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1280, to be held by him under the Right and Sovereignty of the Kings thereof, But, the Male Iſſue failing, it returned to the Crown, and was by Margaret Queen of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark conferred on Gerard Earl of Holſtein, <hi>Anno</hi> 1386. Afterwards repenting of that Act, ſhe extorted it out of the hands of his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; but it was again recovered by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and good Fortune of his Son Adolphus. After whoſe Death, it fell together with Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein to Chriſtiern of Oldenburg King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, by whom it was incorporated with that Crown.</p>
               <p>Next to Sleſwick there are other Places of good note in this Dukedom. As <hi>Gottorp,</hi> near Sleſwick, a ſtrong Caſtle, and the uſual Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Dukes of Holſtein Gottorp, of the Royal Family of Denmark. <hi>Frederick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtad,</hi> on the River Eyder, ſome fourteen miles Weſt of Gottorp. <hi>Tonningen,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs, not above eight miles from that to the Weſtward, and ſeated alſo on the River Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not far from its Influx in to the German Sea; but lately diſmantled by the King of Denmark.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Eyder</hi> is the chief of this Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſule, and was the ancient Boundary betwixt the Saxons and the Danes. It riſes above
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30793:16"/>Rensburg, and parts all the way it runs the Dukedoms of Sleſwick and Holſtein. 'Tis from this River that the ſaid Duke of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein's Country, from Tonningen as far as Huſum, is called <hi>Eyderſtede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Huſum</hi> lies almoſt full North of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen, commodiouſly ſeated on a Bay of the German Sea, and fortified with a Caſtle. Both this Place and Tonningen, as well as Frederickſtad, did lately belong to the Duke of that Name.</p>
               <p>North-Eaſt from <hi>Huſum</hi> you will find <hi>Flensburg,</hi> a noted Town with a Caſtle on a Bay of the Baltick Sea, called Hever Bay. There is a Port ſo deep, ſo ſafe, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, that the very Ships come up cloſe to the Houſes almoſt every where. Further North is <hi>Apenrade,</hi> likewiſe on the Baltick Sea. Six or ſeven miles further you will find <hi>Haderſleben,</hi> a Town of good note, near the Baltick, and over againſt the Iſland of <hi>Funen;</hi> beautify'd with the fair Caſtle of Hansburg, begun to be built by John, the eldeſt Son of King Chriſtiern I. then Duke of Holſtein, but finiſhed by Frederick II. King of Denmark. This Town and Caſtle was in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Wars twice taken by the Swedes, but at laſt reſtored with the reſt. There is one Town more in theſe Parts I thought fit to take notice of; and that is <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> near the German Sea, almoſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30793:17"/>to Apenrade aforeſaid on the Baltick.</p>
               <p>Betwixt Sleſwick and Flensburg is a Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that goes by the Name of <hi>Anglen.</hi> From whence England has got its denomination, ever ſince King Egbert (whoſe Anceſtors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were born in this Tract of Land) cauſed this Kingdom to be called Engel-lond (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned into England) in a Parliament held at Wincheſter, <hi>Anno</hi> 814. So that the Engliſh Nation is not only originally deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Saxons and Danes, but the very Name of England has its original from thence. And, if there ought to be any Ties of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Friendſhip betwixt two Nations ſprung up from the ſame Root, it muſt be betwixt theſe Nations; eſpecially, conſidering the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Manners, the Congruity of Religion as to the main Points, and the ſtricter Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both Crowns by ſuch Royal Matches on both ſides as makes the ſame Bloud run in the Veins of both the Royal Families.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before, that the River Eyder was the ancient Boundary betwixt the Saxons and the Danes. But 'tis obſervable beſides, that in Imitation of the Picts Wall in England, there was within few miles South of Sleſwick a long Trench and Wall from the one Sea to the other; ſo broad, that a Chariot or two Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a breaſt might ride upon it. The ſame was firſt built by Gotricus (or Godfrey) King of Denmark, in the time of Charles the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30793:17"/>Great; either to ſtop the Current of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, or to hinder the daily Incurſions of the Saxons. The Tract thereof, ſtill very eaſy to be ſeen, is called <hi>Danewark</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>South of the Dukedom of Sleſwick lies that of <hi>Holstein.</hi> A woody Country, called Holſtein, from the Dutch word <hi>Holt,</hi> which ſignifies a Wood or Foreſt. The River Eyder divides it Northward from Sleſwick. Weſtward it is bounded partly with the Elb, and Eaſtward with the Baltick. The River Elb, one of the five great Rivers of Germany, divides it from the Dukedom of Bremen, and further South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is bounded with the Dukedom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xen Lawemburg.</p>
               <p>This Country is divided into four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Parts, <hi>viz. Dithmarſen</hi> North-weſtward, <hi>Holſtein</hi> properly ſo called, <hi>Stormaren</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <hi>Wageren</hi> North-caſtward.</p>
               <p>Firſt Holſtein ſpecially ſo called (together with Stormaren) was made an Earldom by the Emperour Lotharius, <hi>Anno</hi> 1134. in the Perſon of Adolph Earl of Schomburg, who had deſerved well of him in his Wars. And, when Chriſtiern Earl of Oldenburg was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Crown of Denmark, <hi>Anno</hi> 1448, he having gotten Dithmarſen of the Emperour Frederick the Third, prevailed ſo far as to have the whole Eſtate erected into a Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be held by him and his Succeſſors of the ſacred Empire.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:30793:18"/>
               <p>The famous Hanſe-Towns of <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> that on the Elb and this on the Trave, both on the Borders of Holſtein and Germany, are reckoned as Towns of Holſtein; though neither of them ſubject to the King of Denmark, nor to the Dukes of Holſtein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamburg</hi> is of that part of Holſtein which is called Stormaren, about ſixteen German miles from Bremen in Germany, ſix Eaſt of Staden, and eight Weſt of Lubeck. It is built at the Influx of the Alſter into the Elb, in a large Plain, with fat and rich Paſtures round about it, the Ships coming up to it a great way with the Tide. This is an ancient City, great, populous, beautiful, and rich, and a Place of vaſt Trading. There is the old and new Town, both ſurrounded with good Walls, and well fortified. The Buildings for the moſt part are of Brick, the Streets ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what narrow, but the publick Structures very fair; eſpecially the Council-houſe, adorned with the Statues of the nine Worthies, carved with very great Art; then the Exchange or Meeting-place for Merchants; and amongſt the Churches S. Nicolas and S. Catharines Church, this laſt having a marble Chair with Figures of Alabaſter, and Ornaments of Gold moſt delicately wrought. It is obſerved, (ſays Heylin) that there were in this Town at one time 177 Brewers, when there was but forty Bakers, one Lawyer, and one Phyſician. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30793:18"/>Reaſon of which Diſproportion was, that a Cup of <hi>Nimis</hi> was their uſual Phyſick; that <hi>Bread</hi> was counted a Binder, and ſo not to be uſed but in caſe of Neceſſity; and that their <hi>Differences</hi> were ſooner ended over a Can than by courſe of Law. This formerly was the Staple Town for Engliſh Cloth, from whence on ſome Diſcontents it was removed to Stade, and at laſt to Holland.</p>
               <p>Anciently Hamburg was an Archbiſhops See, founded by Charles the Great; but tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Bremen, <hi>Anno</hi> 850, with the Conſent of Lewis the then Emperour. Moreri ſays, that Hamburg was ſometime ſubject to the Archbiſhops of Bremen, that afterwards the Hamburgers were under particular Lords of their own, and at laſt came to be under the Dukes of Holſtein. But Heylin, having told us that this City was repaired by Charles the Great, and walled by the Emperour Henry the Fourth, ſays further, that it was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince that time an Imperial City, and made one of the Hanſe, upon the firſt Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thoſe Towns. Which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon a Controverſy ariſing about that time betwixt the Earl of Holſtein and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Hamburg, this Town was adjudged to belong to the Earls of Holſtein, and that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination ratify'd by Charles the Fourth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1374. In purſuance whereof, the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers took the Oath of Allegiance to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern Earl of Oldenburg (the firſt King of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30793:19"/>Denmark of that Houſe) as Earl of Holſtein, acknowledging him and his Succeſſors for their lawful Lords. But ſince that time they have ſlip'd their Necks out of the Collar, and having took upon themſelves to live as a free State, they only pay ſome ſmall Duty to the King of Denmark as Duke of Holſtein; and that rather by way of a Toll upon the account of Gluckſtad that lies betwixt Hamburg and the Mouth of the River Elb, than on any other account. However, the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark ſeems to have a juſt Claim to Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; and he never draws near it with any Forces, but the Hamburghers, jealous of their Liberty, and perhaps conſcious of their Guilt, put themſelves into a Poſture of Defence. In order to which, beſides their conſtant Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the promiſed Aſſiſtance of the reſt of the Hanſe-Towns upon all occaſions, they can raiſe about fifteen thouſand Citizens in Arms to ſtand for their Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the chief of all the Hanſe Towns, was at firſt but a goodly Borough, which Adolphus Earl of Holſtein built <hi>Anno</hi> 1143. in the time of the Emperour Conrade III. But it was ſo well priviledged by the ſaid Earl and his next Succeſſors, that in a ſhort time it bid defiance to its Founders, and was made a Dukedom of it ſelf. By the Emperour Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick I. it was united to the Empire, but after his Death they choſe themſelves another
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30793:19"/>Duke. Who, having governed them five Years, was ſubdued by the Danes, and the City made ſubject to that Kingdom. In which Condition they remained, till delivered by the Emperour Frederick II, by whom being infranchiſed again, it became Imperial, and was afterwards liſted amongſt the Hanſe Towns. <hi>Anno</hi> 1500. John, King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, attempted to reduce this City under his Obedience; which War broke out again in the year 1509, and then the Swedes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed the Lubeckers Quarrel. <hi>Anno</hi> 1547, in Charles the fifth's time, they ſent their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty's to the Emperour, to get a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their Privileges, for which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Imperial Majeſty with 100000 Crowns. <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. they ingaged in a War with Eric King of Sweden, which War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the year 1570. Ever ſince this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has been in a flouriſhing Condition. And, though it has been burnt down ſeveral times, particularly in the year 1238, yet it raiſed it ſelf always out of its Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Tis built upon all the ſides of a riſing Hill, on the top whereof ſtands the Church of St. Mary, whence is a deſcent to all the Gates of the City, affording to the eye a moſt pleaſing Proſpect. The Buildings are very beautiful, and all of Brick, the Streets ſtrait and even, the Churches (Ten in number) in good repair, adorned with excellent Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30793:20"/>and much admired even by skilful Workmen. From the publick Conduit a pipe of Water is conveyed to every Houſe; according to the Pattern whereof the Conduits were firſt made in London, and other Places. In a word, ſays Heylin, there is not any City of Germany, or the more Northern Country's, which can equalize it, either for the Beauty and Uniformity of the Houſes, the pleaſant Gardens, fair Streets, and delightful Walks without the Walls; or for the Citizens themſelves, who are much commended for their Civility to Strangers, and ſtrict execution of Juſtice without Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To which purpoſe I ſhall here ſubjoyn the clear Teſtimony of <hi>Lindebergius</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poet. The firſt ſpeaks of it thus.</p>

               <p>The ſame is ſeated on the borders of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, Lawemburg, and Mecklemburg, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that part of Holſtein which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wageren, not above two German miles diſtant from the Baltick. The River Trave, which runs through the midſt of it, carries Ships of the greateſt burthen; and ſuch is the Trade of this Place, that it is thought above 600 Ships of all ſorts (ſome of a thouſand Tun and upwards) belong to it. Near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mouth is the Fort called <hi>Travemund. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1162, the Biſhops See of Oldenburg was formerly transferred to this Place; the preſent Biſhop being of the Duke of Holſtein Gottorp's Branch. To conclude, Lubeck lives in the form of a Common-wealth, and has made a ſtrict Alliance with the States General of the United Provinces; who included this Town in the ſeventy ſecond Article of their Treaty with Spain, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648.</p>
               <p>Next to Hamburg and Lubeck, the moſt noted Places in Holſtein, and firſt in Wageren, are <hi>Segeberg,</hi> near the head of the River Trave, four German Miles from Lubeck; <hi>Oldiſlo,</hi> on the ſame River, betwixt Segeberg and Lubeck; <hi>Newſtat,</hi> on the Baltick; <hi>Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> North of that; and <hi>Ploen</hi> upon a Lake,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30793:21"/>fortified with a Caſtle, and belonging to a Prince of the Houſe of Holſtein, from hence called the Duke of Holſtein Ploen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Stormaren, <hi>Pinnemberg,</hi> two leagues North of Hamburg; <hi>Crempen,</hi> on a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle River of that name, which falls not far off from hence into the Stoer, and both together not much further into the Elb. A Town well fortifi'd by King Chriſtiern the Fourth, and reckoned one of the Keys of that Kingdom. <hi>Gluckstad,</hi> on the River Elb; which Place was likewiſe repaired and fortifi'd by Chriſtiern the Fourth, to command the Paſſage up the Elb.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in Ditmarſen, <hi>Meldorp,</hi> on the Ocean; the Inhabitants of which are ſo wealthy, that many of them cover their Houſes with Copper; <hi>Brunsbuttel,</hi> at the Mouth of the River Elb; <hi>Heide,</hi> five miles North of Meldorp; and <hi>Lunden,</hi> further North, on the bank of the Eyder.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in Holſtein ſpecially ſo called, <hi>Rensburg,</hi> a Place well fortify'd. <hi>Kiel,</hi> four leagues Eaſt of Rensburg, ſituate on a Bay of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and having a capacious Haven, ſeldom without good ſtore of Shipping from Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Sweden, and Denmark. This Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Duke of Holſtein. 'Tis fortified with a Caſtle, and here the Duke keeps his Courts of Judicature. It ſuffered much by the Wars of Sweden and Denmark, in the late Kings Reign. <hi>Bordeſholm,</hi> on the North
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30793:21"/>end of a Lake; not much obſervable, but for a Monaſtery, in which Henry, one of the Earls hereof (of a younger Houſe) turned Monk, and died <hi>Anno</hi> 1241. <hi>Itzehoe,</hi> on the River Stoer, bordering upon Stormaren.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the aforeſaid Towns, <hi>Kiel, Lunden, Heide, Oldenburg, Ploen, Bordeſholm,</hi> and a few others of leſs Note, belong to the Dukes of Holſtein.</p>
               <p>But 'twill not be improper to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that <hi>Wageren</hi> took its name from the <hi>Wagrii,</hi> a Tribe (or Nation) of the Sclaves, who poſſeſſed this Tract; <hi>Stormaren,</hi> from the River Stoer and the <hi>Marſi,</hi> once the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants hereof; and <hi>Ditmarſen,</hi> from a Mixture of the Dutch and the <hi>Marſi.</hi> Theſe laſt, being naturally of the Saxon Race, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain much of the Stomack and Animoſity of the ancient Saxons; and never were brought under the Command of the Earls of Holſtein, (as Wageren and Stormaren were) till Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein it ſelf was joyned to the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. And, though it was aliened from the Empire by Frederick the Third, and given in fee to Chriſtiern Earl of Oldemburg the firſt King of that Houſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1414; yet would they not ſubmit unto his Authority, but held it out againſt him, and ſome of his Succeſſors, whom in the year 1500. they vanquiſhed in the open Field. But they were at laſt ſubdued by the Valour of King Frederick the Second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1550.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:30793:22"/>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Holſtein</hi> came to be ſubject to the King of Denmark in the Perſon of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern I. Who, being Earl of Oldemburg, was elected to that Crown; and, after the Death of Adolph Earl of Holſtein, his Uncle by the Mothers ſide, (who died without Iſſue) Holſtein came into his hands.</p>
               <p>But then Otho, Earl of Schomborg, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Right unto it, as the next Heir Male, according to the Conſtitutions of the Empire, of which it was holden. On the other ſide Gerard, the Brother of Chriſtiern, put in for his Share, according to the ill Cuſtom of Germany, of which it was then counted part. So that King Chriſtiern was fain to compound with both. To Otho he paid 43000 Florens, and left him withall ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as were the ancient Poſſeſſions of the Earl of Schomborg. And to his Brother Gerard he gave 50000 marks, beſides his whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Earldom of Oldenburg, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Title, according to the faſhion in Germany.</p>
               <p>By this means Holſtein was united to the Crown of Denmark. Which being afterwards inlarged with the Addition of Ditmarſen, it was erected into a Dukedom, by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Frederick III. <hi>Anno</hi> 1474. After which the Kings of Denmark, (as Dukes of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein) were counted Princes of the Empire. Though they neither ſend to the Imperial
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30793:22"/>Diets, nor contribute any thing at all to the Publick Taxes, nor acknowledg any kind of Subjection to it more than meerly Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Only it was ordained, at the requeſt of the Subjects, when firſt they were incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that Kingdom, that in caſe of any Grievance or unjuſt Sentence in the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, wherein they found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the Supreme Council of the Province, it might be lawful for them to appeal to the Imperial Chamber, as they had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Which Grant has been ſo ſeldom made uſe of, that it is in a manner worn out of memory.</p>
               <p>But, ſince this Uniting of theſe two Eſtates, the Title of Duke of Holſtein and a good Part of the Country was in a manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from the Crown, and given to Adolph, Brother of Chriſtiern III, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it interchangeably with the King. Afterwards another part of this Country was beſtowed upon John, younger Brother to Frederick II. Of which two Dukes, and their Succeſſors, you ſhall have a further Account in its proper place.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SEland,</hi> the principal Iſland of Denmark, and the greateſt of the Baltick Sea, lies oppoſite to Schonen in Sweden, and is parted from it by the Sund, as it is from Funen Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the great Belt. The ſame (being the <hi>Codanonia</hi> of the Ancients) is a moſt pleaſant and fruitful Iſland, extending from North to South, ſixteen German miles, and from Eaſt to Weſt about twelve. Now a German Mile is at the leaſt as much as four Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The chief Place of this Iſland is <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> (Lat. <hi>Hafnia,</hi> Dan. <hi>Kiobenhaven</hi>) the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis and uſual Reſidence of the Kings of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. A brave City, grown up from a ſmall beginning. Hues (or Huido) Archbiſhop of Lunden and Biſhop of Roſchild, was the firſt who laid the Foundations of it in the Year 1165; when in the ſame place where now ſtands Copenhagen he cauſed a Fortreſs to be built againſt the Pirates that roved over this Sea, which Fortreſs was called by his Name <hi>Axel Hues.</hi> About which afterwards ſome Fiſhermen built themſelves Cottages, and in proceſs of time the richeſt ſort of them erected not only Store-houſes, but Dwelling-Houſes, fit to receive the Merchants in who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30793:23"/>came to buy their Fiſh. This Commerce drew thither many more Inhabitants, to whom James Biſhop of Roſchild granted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Priviledges and Immunities in the year 1254. Thus in ſucceſſion of time this City, which at firſt was but a few Fiſhermens Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, grew to that greatneſs, that it is now one of the moſt noble Cities of the North. To which ſeveral Kings of Denmark have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed by their Publick Buildings, and granting the Citizens many great Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but eſpecially Chriſtiern the Fourth, the preſent Kings Grandfather, whoſe Memory is ſtill cheriſhed by the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Copenhagen, you muſt know, is ſeated upon the Eaſt-ſide of the Iſland, under the fifty ſixth degree of Northern Latitude. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern the Fourth, having laid the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new City in the little Iſle of Amag (or Amager) joyned it to the old by a Bridge, and called it by the name of Chriſtierns Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. He built alſo a goodly Magazine-houſe, and ſtrengthned the City on the Iſland-ſide with Walls and Bulwarks. Thus Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen is properly divided into two Parts, by that Inlet or Arm of the Sea which parts the old Town from the new. In the new Town, the leſs of the two, is the Royal Caſtle (a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of ancient Structure) with large Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and high Walls about it. There is alſo the Mint, the Exchange, and the Arſenal,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30793:24"/>one of the fineſt in Europe. Wherein is ſeen that wonderful Celeſtial Globe, that has no leſs than ſix foot of diameter, the work of Tycho Brache the great Daniſh Aſtronomer. From this new Town there is a Paſſage to the old over ſeveral Bridges. Here the Streets are broad, and every where furniſhed with Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes. The principal Churches are S. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the Holy Ghoſt, and S. Mary's Church; in which laſt is performed the Coronation of the Kings of Denmark. On this ſide alſo is ſeen the fine Port, the Cittadel, the Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and the Univerſity. Firſt founded by Eric (or Henry) the ninth, but perfected by King Chriſtiern the firſt, and the ſucceeding Princes, by whom it was liberally endowed.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of Amag, which lies on the Eaſt-ſide of the Town, makes a very ſafe Road for all kinds of Shipping. So that the Haven is not only capacious, but moſt commodious and ſafe againſt all Winds of the Baltick Sea. The excellency whereof, as much as any thing elſe, has improved this City to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that when the late King of Sweden came firſt before it in the year 57, he fell in love with her, and ſaid ſhe was a fair Bride worth dancing for.</p>
               <p>This City, as other great Towns, has not only been oppreſſed by Strangers, but has been alſo under the hard Circumſtances of Civil Diſſenſions. For, taking part with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30793:24"/>Chriſtiern II. againſt his Uncle Frederick, it was taken by Frederick, <hi>Anno</hi> 1522. And in the year 1536, after a years Siege, and the Calamity of War and Famine, it was forced to ſurrender it ſelf to Chriſtiern III. After that it injoy'd the Comforts of Peace for a long Series of Years, until Charles Guſtave King of Sweden made War upon it. And, had he won this fair Bride, (as he ſportingly uſed to call her) what a brave Dower had ſhe brought him? But he was fruſtrated of his Expectations, as well by the great Courage and vigorous Reſiſtance of King Frederick, as by the concurrent (but ſtinted) Aſſiſtance of ſuch as were ſelf-concerned in the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Crown.</p>
               <p>Next to Copenhagen <hi>Roſchild</hi> is a Place of good note; ſituate about the middle of the Iſland, four Leagues Weſt of Copenhagen. 'Twas formerly a See Epiſcopal, the Biſhops whereof had the honour of Crowning the Kings of Denmark. In the Cathedral Church are to be ſeen the Tombs of many of the Daniſh Kings, ſome of them very fair and ſumptuous. This City is famous beſides for the Treaty of Peace made here in the Year 1658. betwixt the Kings of Sweden and Denmark, upon the firſt Invaſion of this Country by the Swedes.</p>
               <p>South and by Weſt from Roſchild, almoſt four Leagues off, lies <hi>Sora,</hi> another Town
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30793:25"/>of Seland. Of old times beautify'd with a goodly Monaſtery, the Revenues whereof, at the Change of Religion, were converted to the Maintenance of a Free-School, built here by Frederick I. But in the year 1623. Chriſtiern IV. adding hereunto the Revenues of two other diſſolved Monaſteries, the one in the Iſle of Laland and the other in Jutland, founded here a new Univerſity for the better Supply of Learned Men both for Church and State.</p>
               <p>Northward from Copenhagen you will find <hi>Elſinor</hi> or <hi>Elſineur</hi> (Dan. <hi>Helſingor</hi>) a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sea-Town, with a good Harbour to it. It lies about three Leagues North of Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen, and not above a mile from the Sund.</p>
               <p>At the very Entrance of which Streight, and over againſt the Caſtle of Elſinburg in Schonen, is the famous Caſtle and Palace of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> the ſtrongeſt and moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fortreſs of Denmark. Built with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charge and Pains by King Frederick II, who laid the Foundations of it within the Sea. Into the bottom of which there was ſunk a great number of huge Stones and Flints, locked together with great Oaken Piles, and thoſe faſtned with ſuch Skill and Artifice, that no Storm or Tempeſt, (how violent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) can ſhake it. From this Caſtle, which is in a manner the Key of the Baltick Sea,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30793:25"/>one may eaſily diſcern each Ship which ſails through the Sund into or out of the Baltick. And here it is that all forein Ships pay the Toll to the King of Denmark; except the Swedes, who got themſelves off by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Roſchild. In ſhort, ſuch is the Strength of this Caſtle, and the narrowneſs of the Streight, that the firſt ſeems impregnable, and that by the addition of a few Ships the King of Denmark may keep the greateſt Fleet that is from paſſing by him.</p>
               <p>But yet this very Caſtle was taken by the Swedes in the late Kings time; and this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Structure, the Product of eight years Labour and vaſt Expence, fell in the ſpace of three Weeks into the hands of Field-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Wrangel. Which was principally effected by a Stratagem then uſed by the Swedes. Who, to increaſe the Terror of the Beſieged, gave it out that Copenhagen was taken, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this pretended Conqueſt with the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all their great and ſmall Shot, with the Noiſes of their Drums and Trumpets, with Bonfires, and all other Demonſtrations of Joy. Whereupon the Garriſon was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and threatned with all ſorts of extremities, if they alone ſhould be ſo confident as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to oppoſe their victorious Armies. The Governours, who were then no leſs than three (a ſtout Triumvirate) upon the ſordid Suggeſtions of Fear, and a raſh Credulity,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30793:26"/>ſurrendred this ſtrong Place, Sept. 6. 1658. And yet they wanted neither Souldiers, nor Proviſions, nor Ammunition; but inſtead of thoſe they wanted indeed Courage, Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Fidelity. They were afterwards, ſays my Hiſtorian, condemned by a Council of War at Copenhagen to loſe their Heads; but pardoned by the Kings Clemency, and the Interceſſion of the Mediators for Peace. Tho the truth is, the loſs of that Place was like to have loſt Copenhagen, then cloſely beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as it was, and conſequently the whole Kingdom. So great and univerſal a Terror did the News of this unhappy Surrender ſtrike in the Inhabitants, that now they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as irrecoverably ruined, and there was ſcarce any amongſt them ſo reſolute but was ſhaken at this fatal Truth. The Swedes on the other ſide were not little height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this Victory; whereby they found a great quantity of Gun-powder which they much wanted, and great Proviſion of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and other Inſtruments of War. Neither did they doubt in the leaſt but that Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen would now quickly follow, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved now they were ſecure behind to attack it with their united Forces. But the Beſieged re-aſſumed their wonted Courage, and kept ſtill the Swedes out of doors.</p>
               <p>About three leagues Weſt of Cronenburg you will find <hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> a Royal and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30793:26"/>ſtately Pallace, pleaſantly ſeated on the North ſide of a Lake, among Woods of Beech. There was anciently a Caſtle, known by the name of <hi>Ebelholt,</hi> and an Abbey dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the holy Ghoſt. King Frederick II. was the Founder of this Palace. It has a little Park about it, and therein (amongſt other forein Beaſts) ſome fallow Deer, tranſported hither out of England in the Twenty fourth year of Queen Elizabeth. Afterwards the Pallace was beautified by Chriſtiern the Fourth with fine Statues and Pictures, and other pieces of rare Workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>But there's nothing that recommends this Place ſo much to the Memory of Man as the ſolemn Interview that hapned here betwixt the late Kings of Sweden and Denmark, upon the Concluſion and Ratification of the Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child Treaty. Thither both Kings went, ſays Sir Roger Manley; and, which is remarkable, without any previous Stipulation concerning Gards or Number of Followers (a Thing uſually practiſed upon ſuch Occaſions;) but with a frank and Northern ſimplicity, either not miſtruſting or unwilling to miſtruſt each other. King Frederick met his new Gueſt, coming from Roskild, about two miles from his Houſe. Both Kings, being at a competent diſtance, alighted out of their Coaches at the ſame time; and, approaching on foot, ſaluted each other by joyning their right hands with all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30793:27"/>the reſpect and obliging demonſtrations of Kindneſs imaginable. And now, as if their late Enmity had been intirely forgot, they both entred the ſame Coach; Which being King Frederick's Coach, the King of Sweden ſtept in firſt. There went with them Mr. Meadow the Engliſh Mediator, and the Duke of Holſtein Sunderburg. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at Frederixburg was as ſplendid and magnificent as the Place and Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon could afford. At Table the Queen of Denmark ſat at the Boards end, the King of Sweden on the ſide at her right hand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gueſt, and next below him on the ſame ſide the King of Denmark. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was ſumptuous, the Order exact, and the Solemnity rare, to ſee two Kings at one Table, who had ſo little before been in Arms one againſt the other. It could not be but very pleaſant to hear now thoſe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Kettle-drums loudly proclaim Healths, which ſo lately denounced Death. In ſhort, the Solemnity continued from Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to Saturday, both Kings lodging two nights under the ſame Roof. At parting they exchanged Horſes, and other Preſents; and thoſe Officers of the Daniſh Court, who were particularly appointed to attend the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh King, were nobly regalled by him. On Saturday he took his leave, and went to Elſinor, the King of Denmark accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him part of the way. From thence he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30793:27"/>paſſed the Sound, through the noiſe and ſmoak of the Canon of the two Caſtles of Cronen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg and Elſinburg, to take poſſeſſion of his Purchaſe in Schonen.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide of the Iſland is <hi>Corſoer,</hi> ſituate on the great Belt over againſt Nyburg in Funen, and fortifyed with a Caſtle. Here Auguſt 8. <hi>Anno</hi> 1658. King Charles of Sweden landed his Army from Kiel in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, in his ſecond Expedition againſt Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, but five months after the aforeſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview of the two Kings at Frederixburg. And, though this Army was far greater in reputation than numbers, yet it met with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no reſiſtance. Thoſe few Gards that were on the Coaſts fled at firſt ſight of the Fleet; and the Townſmen, diſſembling what they durſt not ſeem to fear, were fain to receive their Invaders as Friends. 'Tis true the Swedes indeavoured to make them believe, that they intended no hoſtility, but were come to aſſiſt the King of Denmark againſt the Deſigns of ſome of his rebellious Nobles. And therefore King Charles his chief care upon his Landing was to keep his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from plundering, and by quick ſending out of Parties of Horſe to ſuppreſs the Daniſh Troops which were quartered up and down the Iſland, or at leaſt to hinder their Retreat into Copenhagen. Count Tott, Lieutenant-General of the Horſe, led the Van; but the King himſelf did not ſtir till the day following.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30793:28"/>And, though his main hopes of Victory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the quickneſs of his Motion, yet he marched but ſlowly. So that the noiſe of this Invaſion fled to Copenhagen before him, and by his ſlow march he gave the Citizens time enough to recollect themſelves from their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den terrour, and take up Arms in their own defence.</p>
               <p>Sixteen miles North of Corſoer ſtands ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goodly Town by the Sea-ſide, which is called <hi>Calemburg.</hi> In the South Parts of the Iſland you will find <hi>Schelſoer, Newſted,</hi> and <hi>Warburg</hi> or <hi>Warimburg,</hi> in which laſt King Charles ſet his firſt Footing in Seland in his firſt Expedition. There is alſo <hi>Koge,</hi> a fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Place by the Sea-ſide, about Ten miles South-weſt of Copenhagen. Laſtly, they reckon in this Iſland no leſs than 340 Villages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Funen</hi> or <hi>Fuinen</hi> (Lat. <hi>Fionia</hi>) is the next Iſland, both for bigneſs and goodneſs; and much like that, of an orbicular form. It lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Seland and Jutland, parted from that by the great Belt, and from this by the little Belt. It is about Ten German miles long, and Eight broad, every where Pleaſant and Fruitful. There are in it ſeveral good Towns, four Royal Caſtles, and 264 Villages, beſides Gentlemens Houſes.</p>
               <p>The principal Town of all is <hi>Odenſee,</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very midſt of the Iſland, half way
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30793:28"/>betwixt Nyburg on the Eaſt and Middelfare on the Weſt. Built by King Harald, and ſo named from Otho I. Emperour of Germany. 'Twas near this Place that Count Guldenlew, the late King of Denmarks natural Son (now Viceroy of Norway) was overtaken, being ſick in his Coach, by Charles King of Sweden, in his firſt Expedition in theſe Parts. And in the Town it ſelf he ſurpriſed five Daniſh Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſeveral other Fugitives. Which brought the whole Iſland into ſuch a Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that he became preſently the abſolute Maſter of this wealthy Province, and the whole Power of the Enemy in it. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of well nigh 5000 Souldiers and Armed Boors, 60 pieces of Cannon, and great Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of all ſort of Military Proviſions.</p>
               <p>The next Town of note is <hi>Nyburg,</hi> or <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> upon the great Belt, oppoſite to Corſoer in Seland; which is the uſual Paſſage from the one Iſland to the other. Nybourg is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a good capacious Port, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with a Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Here is beſides <hi>Cartemund, Bouvens, Middel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, Aſſens, Vobourg,</hi> and <hi>Swenburg,</hi> all of them ſeated on ſome Haven, or convenient Creek. Amongſt which <hi>Middelfare,</hi> which lies on the little Belt oppoſite to Nybourg on the great Belt, is a Place of good note; from whence the little Belt is alſo called the Middelfare Belt.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:30793:29"/>
               <p>Beſides the Royal Caſtle of Nybourg, there are three other Caſtles; <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Hagenſchow, Hinſgagel,</hi> and <hi>Eſcheburg.</hi> Not far from the firſt of theſe Caſtles is the Mountain of Oſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, where John Rantzovius <hi>Anno</hi> 1530. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the great Army of Chriſtopher, the Brother of Anthony Earl of Oldenburg, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in thoſe unſetled times to invade the Kingdom, under colour of reſtoring Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern II. formerly depoſed. In which Fight the Earls of Hoye and Tecklemburg were both ſlain in the place, and the Kingdom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that in quiet from the like Pretenders.</p>

               <head>Of the leſſer Iſlands of <hi>DENMARK,</hi> viz. <hi>Mone, Falſter, Laland, Langeland, Alſen, Femeren, Bornholm,</hi> and others of leſs note, in the Baltick.</head>
               <p>IN the time of Pomponius Mela, ſays Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, moſt of the chief Iſlands of Denmark were by one general Name called the <hi>Hemodes,</hi> reckoned to be ſeven. Whereas Cluverius and Sanſon are of Opinion, that the Ancients meant by the <hi>Hemodes</hi> the Iſles of Schetland, ſome Leagues North of Scotland, and about the ſame Latitude as Bergen in Norway.</p>
               <p>But, to wave that, let us now take a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the leſſer Iſlands of Denmark. <hi>Mone, Faſter,</hi> and <hi>Laland,</hi> lye pretty cloſe together South of Seland, from which parted by a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30793:29"/>Streight called <hi>Grone-ſund.</hi> And, as Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is bigger than Mone, ſo Laland is bigger than Falſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mone,</hi> or <hi>Meun,</hi> is an Iſland about twelve miles long, and ſix broad, the chief Place whereof is <hi>Stekoe.</hi> The Swediſh Forces that attempted it in April 1659, while the Siege laid before Copenhagen, found here greater Reſiſtance than in any of the other Iſlands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falſter</hi> lies South-weſt from Mone, and is a plentiful Iſland. <hi>Nicoping</hi> is the chief Town herein, which for the neatneſs of the Place and pleaſantneſs of the Situation, is called the Naples of Denmark. But this Iſland in the time of the Swediſh War, run the ſame fortune with the reſt, and was by the Swedes taken from the right Owner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laland,</hi> the largeſt and fruitfulleſt of all theſe Iſlands, lies South-weſt of Falſter. The chief Place thereof is <hi>Naskow,</hi> a Town well fortify'd; which held out moſt ſtoutly againſt the Swedes, when they entred this Iſland in April 1659. But at laſt wanting Powder, and hopeleſs of Relief, the Garriſon was forced to ſurrender.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Langeland</hi> is a long, but narrow Iſland, that lies within few miles Eaſt-Southward of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30793:30"/>of <hi>Traneker.</hi> The Swedes took this Iſland in the Month of March 1659. under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Field-Marſhal Wrangel, and here they began that year the Conqueſt of theſe Iſlands. Which, being the Granary's and Store-houſes of Copenhagen, afforded ſtill freſh Supplies to it. And therefore King Charles, ſeeing no way of conquering Copenhagen but by the Conqueſt of theſe Iſles, reſolved to attempt them. Which he did ſucceſsfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſen</hi> is ſituate near the Eaſtern Coaſt of Sleſwick in Jutland. An Iſle well ſtored with Beaſts for Profit, and Game for Pleaſure. Here is the Caſtle of <hi>Norburg</hi> in the North Parts of the Iſland, and the ſtately Caſtle of <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> Southward. Which laſt gives the Name to a Branch of the Royal Family of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, the Duke of Holſtein Sunderburg. This Iſland was taken by Wrangel next to Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. At laſt, having landed his Men, he took the Caſtle of Norburg by Storm; but he aſſaulted Sunderburg thrice in vain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quitted the Iſland again, and having pillaged the Coaſts of Sleſwick in his way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with his Priſoners and Prey to Funen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Femeren</hi> is another of theſe fruitful Iſlands, and the moſt Southern of all, being ſituate near the Coaſt of Holſtein. Here is <hi>Borg</hi> and <hi>Stubern.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bornholm</hi> is a conſiderable Iſland, and the laſt of all the Baltick which belong to Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. The ſame is ſituate more Eaſtward,

Here is a goodly Town called <hi>Nex,</hi> and a ſtrong Caſtle named <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamer.</hi> This Iſland was formerly pawned to the Lubeckers, who had it in their Poſſeſſion about fifty years; but King Frederick II. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it. By the Treaty of Roſchild it was left to the Swedes. But the King of Denmark has recovered it ſince, by giving an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Royal Demeans in Schonen.</p>
               <p>Beſides the foreſaid Iſlands, which are the moſt conſiderable next to Seland and Funen, and as many Jewels to the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, there are many others of leſs note and bigneſs.</p>

For it furniſhes its Markets abundantly with Meat, Butter, Cheeſe, Hares, domeſtick Fowl, and all ſorts of Kitchin Herbs. There are in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Villages, inhabited partly by Danes, and partly by Dutch. The latter planted here above 150 years ſince, by the Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King Chriſtiern II. who got them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of North-Holland, to make Butter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30793:31"/>and Cheeſe, as being moſt skilful in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
               <p>When the Swedes lay before Copenhagen in their laſt Expedition, theſe Iſlanders got leave of King Frederick to live at their own Houſes with their Proviſions and Cattel, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Promiſes to gard the Avenues of the Iſland, and Aſſurance that they could not be ſo ſurpriſed but they ſhould have time enough to retire, and ſend their Cattel and Proviſions (with their Wives and Children) before-hand into the Town. This my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian calls an unſeaſonable Indulgence of the King, and it proved accordingly. For the Swedes came upon the Iſlanders before they were aware, ſo that they had ſcarce time to ſave their Perſons and their Cattel.</p>
               <p>But the Swedes Stay in the Iſland was not long. For King Charles, having received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intelligence that the Dutch Fleet was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for the Relief of Denmark, quitted his preſent Deſign, with a Reſolution to oppoſe the Advance of theſe Succors. Whereupon, leſt the Danes ſhould over-much rejoyce at his Departure, he commanded all the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Houſes to be pillaged and burnt. A ſad Spectacle for the Danes, who beheld it from their Walls and Towers with much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret. But the King knowing Bewailings were fruitleſs, reſolved to revenge this Violence. The Opportunity was fair, the Swedes being
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30793:31"/>at that time diſperſed through the Iſland, and intent only upon their Plunderings. Therefore the King himſelf marched out with his own Guards, beſides 250 Horſe, a few Dragoons, and a good Troop for the Reſerve; ſome of the nimbleſt Foot having got up behind the Troopers. There marched out likewiſe four light Field-pieces, drawn each of them by ſingle Horſes. The Senators who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent would have diſſwaded the King from hazarding his Perſon, in whoſe Safety their All did conſiſt. But his Majeſty knowing of what moment the Preſence of Princes is in ſuch Encounters, and hearing beſides that the King of Sweden was in the Iſle in Perſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently clap'd Spurs to his Horſe, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his way.</p>
               <p>The Swedes, being alarmed with this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, drew into a Body near a Village called the Hollands Dorp, and were not in all above 400 Men, that is 300 Horſe and 100 Foot. The Danes, finding them in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, charged them bravely, and after ſome Reſiſtance broke and routed them. Nay, Sir Roger Manley does not ſtick to ſay, that, if they had purſued them cloſely, they had in probability taken or ſlain King Charles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Who, together with the Prince of Sulz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach and Wrangel, were forced to a haſty Retreat, leaving above 100 of their Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them upon the Place. But the Danes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30793:32"/>content with this Victory, and loth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſing on't by purſuing it, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Triumph into the Town, their Slain and Wounded not exceeding thirty.</p>
               <p>This Paſſage of the Wars I thought fit to inſert, as much to exalt the perſonal Valour of King Frederick, as becauſe it is ſo rare to ſee one King thus in chaſe of another.</p>
               <p>North of Amag, towards Elſinor, there is a little Iſland called <hi>Ween,</hi> not above three miles long and one broad. Remarkable only for the Studies of that famous Aſtronomer Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Brahe. To whom Frederick II. gave this Iſland; that, living in a private and ſolitary Place, removed from all Company but his own Family only, he might with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience attend his Books. At this day moſt obſervable for the Caſtle of Vraniborg, where the greateſt part of his Mathematical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſafely preſerved.</p>
               <p>Turning weſtward, about Seland, you will find a parcel of little Iſlands, called <hi>Haſelo, Siroo, Muſholm,</hi> &amp;c. of which nothing memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Spro</hi> lies half way betwixt Seland and Funen. South of Funen, towards Langeland, there are indeed two goodly Iſlands, the one called <hi>Taſſing,</hi> and the other <hi>Aroe.</hi> More to the Weſtward you will find <hi>Hellenis, Barſo, Aroe</hi> the leſſer, <hi>Boko,</hi> and <hi>Brandſo.</hi>

               <p>SOme Men are ſo fond of Antiquity, that they care not how fabulous they make their Pedigree, if it be but far-fetched. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſome Danes have endeavoured to make the World believe, that they were ſo called from Dan, a ſuppoſed King who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe Parts above 1000 years before the Birth of our Saviour. And who ſhould this King Dan come from, but from Dan the Son of Jacob? For my part, I ſhould rather think it more probable, that the Danes took their Name from <hi>Sinus Codanus,</hi> the ancient name of the Baltick, their neighbouring Sea.</p>
               <p>However they were ſo called, certain it is that the firſt Inhabitants of Denmark, and chiefly of Jutland, were the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> from whom that Peninſule was called <hi>Cimbrica Cherſoneſus.</hi> Which <hi>Cimbri,</hi> ſays Heylin, were originally deſcended from Gomer, the Son of Japhet; thence called <hi>Gomerii</hi> and <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merii,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:30793:33"/>by Contraction <hi>Cimbri.</hi> Leaving the Plains of Phrygia, as too narrow for them, they ſought out new Dwellings; and are ſaid to have firſt dwelt on the Banks of <hi>Palus Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otis,</hi> where they gave name to the <hi>Boſphorus Cimmerius.</hi> Being overcome by the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they removed their Seats more North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and came at laſt to this Peninſule. Where being grown perhaps too populous for ſo ſmall a Country, they reſolved to ſeek for another, with the Sword in their hands. Receiving, as they did, as many as would joyn with them, they ſwelled to ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Plutarch ſays their Army conſiſted of 300 thouſand fighting Men, beſides Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, which exceeded that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. They forced their way through Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and France, to paſs over into Italy. The Romans ſent Armies to prevent their coming, which were beaten by the <hi>Cimbri.</hi> Manlius, Sillanus, and Caepio, all Roman Conſuls, periſhed by them. And <hi>actum eſſet,</hi> ſays Florus, <hi>de Imperio Romano, niſi illi ſaeculo Marius contigiſſet,</hi> there had been an end of the Roman Empire if Marius had not ſtood for it. Who, not willing to venture on the Enemy united, and lately fleſhed in the Overthrow of Manlius and Caepio, permitted them quietly to paſs by his Camp. So that the Barbarians, who imputed it to fear or cowardize, ſcornfully ask'd his Souldiers,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30793:33"/>What Service they would command them to Rome. But Marius ſoon after ſtopped them in their Career, when for their eaſier Paſſage over the Alps, they had divided themſelves into three ſeveral Bodies. Then, falling upon them ſeverally, he deſtroy'd them all. They were a People of extraordinary big Stature, having blew and red Eyes, and living ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Theft that for their ſakes the Germans called all Thieves <hi>Cimbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Cimbri</hi> having left their Peninſule, the <hi>Saxons, Jutes,</hi> and <hi>Angles,</hi> took Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And, upon the Removal of theſe into Britain, the greateſt part of it was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by the <hi>Danes,</hi> who dwelt in the Iſlands.</p>
               <p>The Danes in general are of a good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, clear of Complexion, well coloured, for the moſt part healthful, and long lived. Their Language is but a Dialect of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tongue. From which it does however ſo differ, that the Danes and Germans cannot underſtand one another, unleſs they do firſt converſe ſome time together. As to their Inclinations, they do not vary much therein from the Swedes and Germans. Only they are look'd upon to be more crafty than the latter, and more ambitious than the former. The Women are fair, courteous, and good Houſwives, fruitful in bearing of Children, and yet delivered of them with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>

               <p>For Men of Learning they have had <hi>Tyche Brahe,</hi> that renowned Aſtronomer; <hi>Hemingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a well known Divine; <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and Philoſopher of very good eſteem; <hi>John Cluverus,</hi> the Hiſtorian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For great Captains, <hi>Gotricus</hi> or <hi>Godfrey,</hi> who ſetled the Government of this Kingdom, and indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the great Monarchy of France; <hi>Sueno</hi> and <hi>Canute,</hi> the fortunate Conquerours of England; <hi>Waldemar</hi> III. a right valiant Prince, but unſucceſsful in his Wars againſt the Hanſe-Towns; <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> II. a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, but a cruel Prince; <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> IV. little inferiour to many of his Predeceſſors. Amongſt whom we may liſt Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Semiramis of theſe Northern Countries; a Lady of a Maſculine Spirit, no leſs fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than daring in her Enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>This Nation was converted to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith in the time of King Harold, about 650 years ago. Till then it cannot be ſaid that the Chriſtian Religion was rooted here, though I read of ſome Chriſtian Kings before this, as <hi>Eric</hi> and <hi>Froto,</hi> both living in the ninth Century. Neither was the Goſpel ſo well fix'd in Harold's time, but that the Danes relapſed ſtill for the moſt part to their ancient Heatheniſm; till they were finally regained by Pope Adrian the Fourth, an Engliſhman. In proceſs of time the Popes of Rome would needs pretend ſome Power and Juriſdiction
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30793:34"/>over them. Which when they began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe with too much Authority, King Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demar III. (the Father of Queen Margaret) is ſaid to have return'd this Anſwer, <hi>Naturam habemus à Deo, Regnum à Subditis, Divitias à Parentibus, Religionem à Romanâ Eccleſiâ; quam ſi nobis invides, renuntiamus per Praeſentes.</hi> That is to ſay, We hold our Life from God, our Crown from our Subjects, our Riches from our Anceſtors, our Religion from the Church of Rome; which Religion, if you envy us, we do here remit it by theſe Preſents. But this Renunciation, though then threatned, was not made till afterwards. King Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick I. was he that aboliſhed the whole Maſs of Popery, uſing therein the Miniſtry of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhage, a Divine of Pomeren, by whom the Danes were reformed according to the Doctrine of the Lutheran Churches. And ever ſince they have continued in that ſtate of Reformation, wherein the Church of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark differs not much from the Church of England. For, as they have rejected ſeveral Errors and Abuſes of the Church of Rome, ſo they have ſtill retained a ſettled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Liturgy for all their Churches, moſt of the Holy-days obſerved in the former Ages, the Croſs in Baptiſm, Kneeling at the Communion, and many other practicable Ceremonies tranſmitted to us from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:30793:35"/>
               <p>The main Point, wherein they differ as Lutherans from all other Proteſtants, is the Article of Conſubſtantiation, whereby they believe that in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper the Elements of Bread and Wine remain in Subſtance with the real Body and Blood of our Saviour after the Conſecration.</p>

               <p>THis Kingdom has been till of late Elective, and not Hereditary, whatever Heylin pretends to the contrary. 'Tis true the Danes have uſually preferred the Royal Family, and ſet the eldeſt Son on the Throne of his Father. But, becauſe the Houſe of Auſtria (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) has hitherto injoy'd the Imperial Crown above 240 years ſucceſſively, I hope it do's not follow therefore that the Empire is not Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. 'Tis well known that in Denmark, after the death of Chriſtopher, the Crown was transferred to the Houſe of Oldenburg, who held it on no other ground but by that of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And about 160 years ago was not King Chriſtiern II. outed of his Eſtate, and Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick advanced unto it? But Dr. Heylin eludes that, by ſaying that ſuch things have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Eſtates that were clearly Hereditary, and ought to make no Precedent, and that Acts of Violence and Force are only juſtifi'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30793:35"/>by the falſe Topick of Succeſs. When all is done, 'tis undeniable that the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark was formerly Elective, if we conſider that it was made in due form Hereditary no longer ago than the year 1660, in the Perſon of King Frederick. Which hapned thus, ſoon after the Treaty concluded that very year betwixt his Majeſty and the now King of Sweden.</p>
               <p>The Clergy and Commonalty had been always jealous of the great Power of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and more particularly during the War with Sweden. They therefore being now armed, eſpecially the People, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently capable of all things, ſecretly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together, as well out of hate to the Nobles, as out of gratitude to the King, for his Fortitude in preſerving of them, to make him Hereditary Monarch of their Crown. Their declared Reaſons were, that being his Majeſty had undergone in his War with Sweden all imaginable Dangers, and that he had with admirable Conſtancy and Magnanimmity demonſtrated his affection and willingneſs in Conſervation of his People and Kingdom, they were of opinion that ſo great Benefits ought not to be let paſs without the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and ſome extraordinary Marks of their Gratitude. Which could not be better expreſſed, than by preſenting the Crown to his Majeſty's Line by Succeſſion. Wherein
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30793:36"/>they were the more incouraged by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a neighbouring Kingdom <hi>(meaning that of Sweden)</hi> where the ſame Thing had been done with good Succeſs, and notable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the People.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution being taken, theſe two States appointed Deputy's to inform the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their deſign, and deſired them to communicate it to the Nobles, whom they acknowledged to be the firſt and moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Part of the Whole. They farther wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to cooperate in perſwading them to a Compliance in this Point, that they might all joyntly agree in ſo reaſonable and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Undertaking.</p>
               <p>After great Deliberation they were anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Propoſition was not ſo new but that ſeveral Diſcourſes had been had about it heretofore, and that very important Reaſons had been produced Pro and Con in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But that the Nobility could not forbear complaining of the Informality uſed herein, namely, that a Buſineſs of ſo great weight ſhould not only come abroad ſo ſecretly and without the leaſt Communication, but alſo poſitively be agreed on and concluded. In ſhort, it was deſired on their part, that the Senators and Nobility ſhould not be further preſſed herein, and that they might at leaſt have time allowed them orderly to deliberate hereof amongſt themſelves. But the other
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30793:36"/>two Bodies, declining with civil Excuſes the point of Informality, inſiſted upon an Anſwer to the principal Matter, and the Conformity of the Nobles with the other two Members.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, finding them dilatory, and that their Anſwer would prove none or nothing to the purpoſe, they reſolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and joyntly preſent their Propoſition to his Majeſty; which rendred it as to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable. The King behaved himſelf in ſuch a manner as if he neither had nor did deſire it; but ſo that he would not decline or refuſe it, if it were preſented to him formally and by the three States. The Clergy and People made new Inſtances. So that the Nobles, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Remedy, ſeemed to yield, <hi>ut praeveniant, ne quod faciunt feciſſe videantur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe Traverſes the Gates were ſhut at Copenhagen, the Watch doubled, the Citizens upon their Gard, and all Courts lock'd up. The Nobility, leſt it might be done without them, conformed at laſt with the other two Bodies. Thus going joyntly to the Caſtle, they preſented the King, firſt with the Crown hereditarily by Succeſſion, <hi>ad Progeniem maſculinam.</hi> But, perceiving that the Clauſe was not pleaſing to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, it was by a new Reſolve offered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <hi>ſine diſcrimine Sexûs.</hi>

               <p>On Wedneſday the 27th. of October the Solemnity of the Inauguration was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as much State as the Time would permit. The Trumpets and Kettle-Drums had ſummoned the Horſe and Foot to aſſiſt at the Ceremony. Three Troops were drawn up by the Tennis Court, ſeven Colours of Foot being ranged by them. Four Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were alſo placed behind the Stage or Theatre erected on purpoſe, and ſeven Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies more over againſt the Caſtle, by the Bridge going to the Iſland. About ten a Clock the Burgers in twelve Companies marched, and placed themſelves from the Caſtle-Bridge to the Theater, garding the Paſſage on both ſides with their Militia. The Stage was eight or ten Steps high, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward four Steps higher were placed two
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30793:37"/>Chairs of State, covered with purple Velvet, over which was a rich Canopy. Further, on the Kings ſide, were two Stools for the two Princes; and on the Queens, three more for the three Princeſſes. There were likewiſe Benches on each ſide the Theater, covered with Scarlet; the right ſide being for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and the left for the Queens Ladies.</p>
               <p>About Noon the Court deſcended from the Caſtle, the Senators or great Counſellors leading the Van. Four whereof carry'd the Regalia, to wit, the Crown, the Scepter, the Apple or Globe, and the Sword; which were laid upon a Buffet or Table placed before the Kings Chair, and covered with a purple Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Carpet. The King followed next alone, then the Queen and her Children, all under a Canopy of Crimſon Satten, born by eight principal Men, for they had then no titular Lords. The King, Queen, and Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated, were environed with the Senate, Nobles, and Courtiers, who ſtood below on the Stage. And, after ſome uſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (under which Kneeling was not omitted) the Oath of Allegiance was read by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, containing a Promiſe of Fidelity to the King, Queen, and Royal Family, as <hi>Hereditary</hi> King of Denmark. This was firſt taken by the Senators, then by the Nobility, then the Courtiers, Deputies of the Clergy and Corporations, and laſtly by the Boors
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30793:38"/>of Amag, who being of Dutch Extraction and free, depend ſolely on the King. The Oath was in theſe Words;</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Most Gracious King, I A.</hi> B. <hi>do promiſe and declare, that I will be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your Royal Majeſty, as my moſt gracious</hi> Hereditary <hi>King and Lord, as alſo to your Royal Family; That I will endeavour and further your Majeſty's Intereſt in all things, and to the best of my Power defend You from all Dangers and Harm; and that I will faithfully ſerve your Majeſty, as a Man of Honour and an</hi> Hereditary <hi>Subject ought to do. So help me God, and his holy Goſpel.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The Oath being thus taken, their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties were humbly congratulated by all (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Boors) mounting in order up the four ſteps, and after their profound Abaiſance returning each to his Station. So that the Ceremony laſted till near three a Clock; at which time the Court returned in the ſame Order they came, and the Gates thereupon were opened.</p>
               <p>Thus King Frederick was a greater Gainer than Loſer by the Swediſh Wars; the Crown being now intailed to his Houſe, from which it might have gone by way of Election.</p>

               <p>The Kings yearly Revenue does chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Toll laid upon all Ships which paſs through the Sound. The greatneſs of which Revenue may be gueſſed at by the multitude of Ships which of Neceſſity muſt paſs by it in the Trade of the Baltick. Though I confeſs the number of them was much greater before the Engliſh removed the Trade of Narva to Archangel in Moſcovy, upon their Diſcovery of the North-eaſt Paſſage. Beſides that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is much leſſened, ſince the Swedes, both by the Roſchild Treaty, and that in the year 1660, have freed themſelves from that Toll. Nay, there have been ſeveral Projects on foot, which (if they took) would curtail it much more. As the Deſign of joyning the Baltick to the Elb by the Lake of Swerin in Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemburg, the tranſporting of Merchandizes by Land from Hamburg to Lubeck, and the Malraſe Canal in Brandenburg in order to convey the Merchandizes of Poland and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30793:39"/>from the River Oder through the Spree upon the Elb. But, till theſe Projects take better than they have hitherto done, the Sound is ſafe enough, and not like to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over.</p>
               <p>Beſides this important Revenue of the King from the Sound, there is a great year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Toll made of the Cattel which paſs into Germany, as alſo of the Fiſh tranſported into other Countries. Now Fiſh and Cattel being the two main Things that are exported out of Denmark, the firſt by Sea, and the laſt by Land over into Germany, the Incomes of Cuſtom-houſes, as to other Commodities, are not exceeding great. But on the other ſide, the Acceſſion of the Crown-Lands is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Kings Revenues are ſuch, that he keeps a handſom Court, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a good Fleet, with ſeveral Garriſons he has in his numerous Forts and Frontire-Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As to the Forces which he is able to raiſe, that may beſt be ſeen by ſome of his Royal Predeceſſors particular Undertakings. As of Chriſtiern II; who at the Requeſt of Henry II. of France, ſent a Fleet of a hundred Sail into Scotland, and therein no fewer than 10000 Souldiers; And of Frederick his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, then Duke of Holſtein, who in his Wars againſt this Chriſtiern (whoſe Removal from the Crown he had projected) brought 50000
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30793:39"/>Men into the Field to make good his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. In ſhort, conſidering the many Ports and Iſlands this Crown is Maſter of, both within the Baltick and without, it cannot be but the King may ſuddenly raiſe a ſtrong Power at Sea. And then, conſidering that each of the Nobility, which are here nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough, is bound to find a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horſe upon all Occaſions, as are thoſe alſo who hold Lands of the King (which the Danes call Verlehninge) there is no doubt but he is able to make good Levies for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Service, eſpecially in defence of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>For State-Affairs, the King has his Council of State, with whoſe Advice he determines either of Peace or War, enters into new Leagues or Confederacies, and impoſes Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes upon his Subjects as occaſion requires. In this Juncture of time this Court ſeems enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with France with an Eye upon Sweden, in order perhaps to recover from that Crown, by the Aſſiſtance of France, what has been formerly extorted from the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark by the Treaty of Roſchild. Schonen is a fine Country Eaſt of Seland, which, till that Treaty, belonged to Denmark; and, if the King of Denmark ſhould attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it by ſuch means as God has put into his hands, 'twere but repelling Force by Force, and endeavouring to regain that by Force of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30793:40"/>Arms which Charles Guſtave, by the terrour of his Arms, extorted from Frederick. I paſs by the Act of Calmar, whereby the Swedes bound themſelves to a perpetual Union with Denmark, under the lawful Succeſſors of Queen Margaret. Which Act was afterwards confirmed, upon the Coronation of Eric, her immediate Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>For all Cauſes and Controverſies, ſuch is the Conſtitution of this Crown, that they are firſt to be decided in the Herets (or Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures) where they firſt ariſe. From whence it is lawful to appeal to the Judge of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, from him to the Chancellor of the Kingdom, and finally to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much as to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Denmark, and of the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme thereof, I ſhall now preſent you with the Chronological Succeſſion of the Kings of Denmark, with an Hiſtorical Abſtract of thoſe Kings Lives that have any thing worth taking notice of. The Daniſh Authors make a great Catalogue of fabulous Kings ſince King <hi>Dan,</hi> which (being unwilling to impoſe upon the Publick) I ſhall freely paſs over. I could begin, as Heylin, with <hi>Gotricus,</hi> whom he looks upon as the firſt Legiſlator of the Danes, and the Eſtabliſher of their Kingdom. But I ſhall content my ſelf to begin with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of Denmark,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30793:40"/>that ſettled the Chriſtian Religion in thoſe Parts, and who began his Reign about the Year 927.</p>

                  <hi>Harold</hi> I. (according to our Account) was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, ſeeing (for a Proof of it) a Clergy-man carry a burning hot Iron in his hands, without any hurt. Whereupon he became the Apoſtle of the North, and prudently governed his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. His Son, being ſtill a Heathen, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged War with him, and ſlew him in a Battel Sept. 1. <hi>Anno</hi> 980.</p>
               <p>That Son was <hi>Sueno</hi> I. (otherwiſe called <hi>Swain</hi>) his immediate Succeſſor. At firſt a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Goſpel, as well as an Uſurper of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30793:41"/>the Throne in his Father life-time, and a great Scourge unto the Engliſh. Being outed of his Eſtate by Eric King of Sweden, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpel, regained his Kingdom, and re-eſtabliſhed Chriſtianity in it, his War on England ſtill continuing. He was King of Denmark by Birth, and of Norway by Conqueſt. Which laſt he conquered from Olaus, then King of Norway.</p>
               <p>After Sueno's Death, both Denmark and Norway fell to the ſhare of his eldeſt Son <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> whilſt his younger Son Canute fixed in England. Olaus having reigned Ten years in the North, and dying without Iſſue, left his two Crowns to his Brother <hi>Canute</hi> I. ſurnamed the Great, but the ſecond Canute in the general Account. His Father Sueno being dead, he went on in his Conqueſts againſt King Edmund, ſurnamed Iron-ſide, who ſucceeded Ethelred. After ſome Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, he at laſt came off victorious in a field-Fight. Then he challenged his Rival to a ſingle Combat, which made them Friends; but he obliged him to divide his Kingdom with him. Not long after which, Edmund having been baſely murdered by Edward (ſurnamed the Outlaw) his eldeſt Son, King Canute brought the Murderers to a condign Puniſhment, and took upon himſelf the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole Kingdom. After that he conquered Sweden, and brought the Crown
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30793:42"/>of Scotland to a ſtate of Vaſſalage. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Emma the Widow of Ethelred, and Daughter of Richard Duke of Normandy. In the year 1027 he went in Pilgrimage to Rome, and died eight years after, leaving the Northern Crowns to Canute, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Harold his baſe Son. He had a Daughter called Elfgine, who was married to the Emperour Henry III.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canute</hi> II, ſecond Son of Canute I, was firſt of all King of Denmark, and afterwards of England, upon the death of his elder Brother Harold, who died not long after his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1040. He was kindly received by the Engliſh, but he proved very unkind to 'em. For he cauſed ſeveral of the chief Men of the Kingdom to be put to death, and he oppreſſed the People with heavy Taxes. To avenge the Injuries done to his Mother Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma by Harold, he cauſed him to be digged out of his Grave, and his head to be caſt into the Thames. Two years after his coming to the Crown, he went to a Wedding in Lambeth, where he fell off his Chair, and died. Some thought he had been poiſoned. However, he being dead, the Engliſh took up Arms, and made a riddance of the Danes. This is that King Canute, which was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Hardy Canute.</p>
               <p>To him ſucceeded King <hi>Magnus</hi> in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, who governed that Kingdom the ſpace
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30793:42"/>of four years. He was Son of Olaus King of Norway.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sueno</hi> II, was Siſters Son of Canute I, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our account) by Ulſo an Engliſh Duke. 'Twas he that reſtored the Kingdom of Norway to the Norwegians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harold</hi> II, was Son of that Sueno. There is nothing memorable of him that I can find at preſent, but that he was ſurnamed the Idle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canute</hi> III, was Brother of that Harold. He attempting to recover England, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the Altar in the Church of St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, <hi>Anno</hi> 1081, and after that ranked among the Martyrs. A Son of his, called by his Name, did likewiſe ſuffer Martyrdom, and was canonized a Saint, <hi>Anno</hi> 1164, by Pope Alexander IV. The Church of Rome cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates his Day on the 19th of January. I ſuppoſe this is that Canute, who was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of Odenſee in Funen, whom Heylin miſtakes for his Father.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Olaus,</hi> I find nothing of him that's memorable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> I, ſurnamed the Good, was Brother of Canute the Saint. He, being a Religious Prince, took a Voyage to Rome, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Holy Land, with his Queen Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe; and he died in Cyprus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harold</hi> III, was baſe Son of Eric. 'Tis ſaid he was murdered by his own Brother.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:30793:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> II, called the Baſtard, a cruel and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Prince, was alſo aſſaſſinated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> III, Son of Anna Siſter of Eric II, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him. He was ſurnamed the Lamb, becauſe of his ſweet Nature. But he had no Fortune in his Wars with the Swedes. At laſt he retired into a Monaſtery, and there died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canute</hi> IV. was ſlain at a Feaſt by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sueno</hi> III, who was likewiſe murdered by his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waldemar</hi> I, Son of Canute, the lawful Son of Eric I, by whoſe means the Rugians and Vandals embraced the Goſpel. He was the firſt that reduced the Laws into a ſet form and Writing. And by his Laws the Biſhops were to ſit with the Council of State in all Cauſes of moment. But they were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from that Employment by King Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern III.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canute</hi> V. was the Son of Waldemar, and of Sophia Siſter to Canute the Fourth. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reigned ſome time with his Father, he at laſt ſucceeded him. He made War to the Pomeranians, and is ſaid to have been marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mathildis Daughter of Henry the Lion Duke of Saxony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waldemar</hi> II, Brother of Canute the Fifth, was Duke of Sleſwick before his coming to the Crown.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:30793:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> IV, Son of Waldemar the Second, was married to Agnes, the then Marqueſs of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh's Daughter. He ſhewed a great deal of good Conduct in his Government. But he was murdered by his Brother</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abel,</hi> the ſecond Son of Waldemar the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Who did not long enjoy his Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For two years after he came to the Crown (by an Act, more Cain than Abel-like) he was kill'd himſelf by the Boors in the Friſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land War. And it is ſaid, that the Place, where he was inhumed, ſwarmed with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and ſtrange Apparitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> I, the youngeſt Brother of the foreſaid Abel and Eric, was no Admirer of Prelates. He reigned with a various Fortune, and at laſt was taken Priſoner in his War againſt the Earls of Holſtein. Some Authors are of opinion, that he did not die before the year 1268.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> V, ſurnamed the Old, was Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher his Son. His Reign of twenty eight years was bleſſed with Peace and Plenty, but he was ſlain by the Practices and Treaſon of his Officers. Mathildis, Daughter of Albert, called the Great Duke of Brunſwick, was his Queen. By whom he had, amongſt other Children, his Son and Succeſſor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eric</hi> VI, ſurnamed the Young, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Chriſtopher, his Elder Brother. He began his Reign with a ſevere Puniſhment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30793:44"/>of his Father's Murderers. He took Roſtock (now a Hanſe Town) in Mecklemburg, and ſome other Places; and he married with the Siſter of Birger King of Sweden, by whom he left no Iſſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> II, elder Brother of Eric, added the Iſland of Rugen to the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and gave Roſtock in fief to the Dukes of Mecklemburg. The Earls of Holſtein beat him out of his Kingdom, and he was twice reſtored to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waldemar</hi> III, was Son of Chriſtopher. A ſtout Prince, but unfortunate in his Wars with the Hanſe Towns; which confederated againſt him, and vanquiſhed him in many Battels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter of Waldemar the Third, gave her ſelf in Marriage to Aquin King of Norway, and ſo united the Kingdoms. They had a Son named Olaus, a hopeful Prince, but he died young. Aquin her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and Olaus her Son, being dead, ſhe ſtood ſtill at the Helm; and, not contented with two Crowns, ſhe put in for a third. In ſhort, ſhe attempted by force of Arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Crown of Sweden. She raiſed a fine Army, and appeared at the head of it. Albert, Duke of Mecklemburg, was then King of Sweden. He was Son of Euphemia, the Siſter of Magnus IV. of Sweden, and got that Crown, to the prejudice of Aquin the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30793:44"/>Husband of Margaret. For you muſt know, that Magnus IV. King both of Sweden and Norway, had two Sons, Eric and Aquin aforeſaid. Eric, his eldeſt Son, was his deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Succeſſor in the Crown of Sweden, whilſt in his Life-time he beſtow'd the Crown of Norway upon Aquin. Eric dies before his Father, and after his death the Father himſelf was outed of his Kingdom by the practice of Albert, his Nephew aforeſaid. Queen Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet therefore, having raiſed a good Army, undertook to do her ſelf Juſtice, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs Albert of his Inchroachments. By that time Albert was grown a worſe Tyrant than his Predeceſſor; which made the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that had raiſed him up to the Throne, ſeek the means to unthrone him. So that all things ſeemed to concur for the Succeſs of Queen Margarets Deſign. And indeed ſuch was her Valour and the Fortune of her Arms, that ſhe gave the Swedes Battel in the Year 1387, defeated their Army, and took their King Priſoner. A bloody Battel it was, ſays my Author. Albert was kept Priſoner for the ſpace of ſeven years. To get his Liberty, he freely reſigned his Kingdom to Margaret, and ſo went to his own Country, where he died. Upon his Reſignation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1394, ſhe cauſed an Act of State to be paſſed in Calmar, for the Perpetuation of this Union unto her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. In ſhort, this was a Princeſs of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30793:45"/>Temper ſo far beyond her Sex, that all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians cry her up as the Wonder of her Age, and a ſecond Semiramis.</p>
               <p>Before ſhe died, ſhe was ſollicitous to find a worthy Succeſſor. Ingelburgis, her Siſter, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her one, namely <hi>Eric</hi> her Son, whom ſhe got by Vratiſlaus Duke of Pomeren. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet accepted of him, and got him crowned in her Life-time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1396, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the States of the three Kingdoms. The Arch-biſhop of Upſal performed the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and thereupon a Law was made that the three Kingdoms ſhould never be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. This Eric (the ſeventh in our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) begun his Reign in the year 1412, and was Knight of the Garter. His Cruelties ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſo odious to his Subjects, that they roſe up in Arms every where againſt him. <hi>Anno</hi> 1424 he went to the Holy Land. And in the Year 1439, weary of ſwaying the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he retired into Pomeren, where he lived twenty years longer. So that he was no leſs than 77 Years old, when he died. During that Retirement, 'tis ſuppoſed by ſome, that he writ the Hiſtory of Denmark, which begins thus, <hi>Dani, ut teſtantur veteres Hiſtoriographi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eric having thus reſigned his Kingdoms to live a private Life, there was an Interregnum for the ſpace of ſix years, till <hi>Chriſtopher III.</hi> came in by Election. He was Duke of Bavaria (but in Title only) Son of John
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30793:45"/>Count Palatine of the Rhine, and of Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Siſter of Eric. Though he was very mild in his Government, yet his Subjects were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at him for beſtowing the great Places of Truſt upon Germans, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to confer upon the Natives. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Dorothy of Brandenburg; and, after a Reign of three Years, died without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. Whereby he made way to the Crown for the Houſe of Oldenburg, the preſent Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family of Denmark. And then the Swedes, weary of the Daniſh Government, choſe a King of their own, Charles Canute, without any regard to the Act of Calmar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christiern I,</hi> Earl of Oldenburg, was Son of Theodorick Earl of Oldenburg, and of his Wife Hedwige, Siſter of Adolph Earl of Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick and Holſtein. Which Earl, being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Crown of Denmark, declined it by reaſon of his Age and want of Children; but he recommended in his ſtead Chriſtiern his Nephew and next Heir; who thereupon was choſen King of Denmark. After his Uncles Deceaſe, he ſucceeded him in the Eſtates of Holſtein and Sleſwick, continuing ſince united unto that Crown. And, by the Aſſiſtance of the Biſhop of Upſal, he recovered the Crown of Sweden. But he loſt it again; and after that Sweden was governed for a time by Marſhals.</p>
               <p>According to Moreri, 'twas by this King Chriſtiern that the chief Order of Knighthood
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30793:46"/>in Denmark, called the Order of the Elephant, was inſtituted, and that at the Wedding of his Son John.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John,</hi> the Son of Chriſtiern the Firſt, was crowned King of Sweden, the next Year after his coming to the Crown of Denmark. But, not keeping Conditions with the Swedes, they turned him out, and returned to their former Government under Marſhals. King John upon that raiſed an Army of 50000 Men, in order to recover that Crown. But his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours proved fruitleſs. Chriſtina, his Queen, was Daughter of Erneſt, Elector of Saxony. By whom he had, amongſt other Children, his Son and Succeſſor</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> II, ſurnamed the Cruel, or the Tyrant. Few Years after he was ſet upon the Throne of his Father, (that is, in the Year 1518.) He raiſed an Army againſt Sweden, and went by Sea to beſiege Stockholm. But he was forced at laſt to raiſe the Siege. They had at that time in Sweden a Triumvirate of Marſhals, who governed the Kingdom. Two of them died natural Deaths, and the laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Chriſtiern II. ſlain in Battel, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was again poſſeſſed by the Danes. And then King Chriſtiern promiſed his new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects all manner of Clemency and Lenity on his part. But he could not forbear gratifying his barbarous Inclinations. In order to which he invited the chief Men of the Kingdom,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30793:46"/>both Spiritual and Temporal, and in the midſt of the Feaſt he cauſed them to be put to Death. Which Inhumanity was ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſented by the Swedes, that they roſe up in Arms, under the Conduct of Guſtave Eric, and drove once more the Danes out of Sweden. On the merit of which Action, Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtave Eric, deſcended from the ancient Race of the Kings of Sweden, was choſen King of Sweden; and in his Houſe that Crown ſtill continues. Chriſtiern, being returned to Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, where he continued his Crimes, was likewiſe expelled from thence; and then Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, his Uncle, ſucceeded him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Chriſtiern fled into the Low-Countries, with Elizabeth his Wfe, Siſter of Charles the Fifth and Ferdinand, both Emperours. After ten Years Exile, he attempted, with the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers Aſſiſtance, to regain the Crown he had loſt, to whom therefore he promiſed vaſt Priviledges upon the Baltick. But he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner, and after twenty ſeven Years Confinement in Priſon, he died, in the year 1559, aged about ſeventy eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> I, ſurnamed the Pacifick, was Brother of John and Uncle of Chriſtiern the Second. He was choſen King of Denmark and Norway, upon the Abdication of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; and took up the Crown upon ſuch Terms as made him little more than a titular King. 'Twas he however that brought in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30793:47"/>the Reformed Religion in both Kingdoms, according to the Confeſſion of Augsburg. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1532. he clapt his Nephew, Chriſtiern the Second, in Priſon; and not long after he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life, leaving four Sons that he got by Ann of Brandenburg. The eldeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was his immediate Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern III,</hi> the eldeſt Son of Frederick the firſt, ſuppreſſed with great Trouble the Party formed againſt him in behalf of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern the ſecond. He perfected the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation begun in the time of his Father. And as he was a Lover of Learning, ſo he proved a great Benefactor to the Univerſity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen. Dorothy, his Queen, was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Magnus Duke of Saxony. He got by her three Sons and two Daughters. His Sons were Frederick, his Succeſſor; Magnus, who was Biſhop of Hapſel in Livonia; and John. Of his two Daughters, the Lady Ann was married to Auguſtus, Elector of Saxony; and the Lady Dorothy, to Henry Duke of Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</p>
               <p>As the Emperour Charles V. prohibited and enacted, that no Eccleſiaſtical Perſon ſhould buy any immoveable Goods without the Princes Conſent; ſo this King Chriſtiern ordained, that the Clergy ſhould ſell no Church Lands without leave of the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick II,</hi> Son of Chriſtiern the Third, ſubdued Ditmarſen, a part of Holſtein, till
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30793:47"/>then unconquered by the Danes, or Earls of Holſtein. He warred againſt Lubeck, and Eric King of Sweden. When Pope Pius IV. deſired him by a Nuncio to ſend ſome body from him to the Council of Trent, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it, ſaying, that he would have no Commerce with Popes. He very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Univerſity of Copenhagen, and was a great Admirer of the Learned, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of Tycho Brahe. Sophia his Queen was Daughter of Ulric Duke of Mecklem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. He got by her three Sons, and four Daughters. His eldeſt Son Chriſtiern ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but Ulric and John died young and without Iſſue. His eldeſt Daughter Elizabeth was ſecond Wiſe to Henry-Julius Duke of Brunſwick; Ann was given in Marriage to James King of Great Brittain; Hedwige, to Chriſtiern the Second, Elector of Saxony; and Auguſta, to John Adolph Duke of Holſtein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern IV,</hi> Son of Frederick the Second, Brother of Ann Queen of Great Brittain and Knight of the Garter, ſucceeded his Father at the Age of twelve Years. Four Counſellors were appointed to be Regents during his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, and he was not crowned till the year 1596.</p>
               <p>In the Month of July, <hi>Anno</hi> 1606, he came over into England, to viſit the King and Queen. He had been long expected, when at laſt News were brought to Court, that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30793:48"/>was come with eight Ships into the River of Thames, and that he anchored before Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end. This hapned on the ſeventeenth of July; and the next day King James, with Prince Henry, and divers of the Lords, went by Barge to meet this Royal Gueſt, and bring him up to London. Where he ſtayed about four Weeks, being entertained all that while with all the Magnificence that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Both Kings did ride in great ſtate through the City, there being Pageants ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in many Places. He was ſhewed the chief Places about the Town, as the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the Tower, the Monuments at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter; and, that he might have a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the City and Suburbs, he went to the top of Pauls. No manner of Paſtime was omitted to divert ſo welcome a Gueſt, and the Earl of Salisbury feaſted him at Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds four days together. At laſt on the twelfth of Auguſt, being conducted by the King, the Queen, and Prince, with many other great Lords, he departed to his Ships, and arrived in eight days at home.</p>
               <p>In July 1614. he came the ſecond time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, but Incognito, and with a ſmall Company. The Queen was ſurpriſed to ſee him arrived at Somerſet Houſe, before ſhe knew any thing of his Coming. King James was then in Progreſs in Bedfordſhire, who heard no ſooner of it but he came back. He
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30793:48"/>admired his Frankneſs as well as his Affection, and thanked him heartily for both. In return whereof, he regalled him with all the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Marks of Kindneſs and Gratitude. And King Chriſtiern returned, Aug. 1, extreamly ſatisfy'd with his Entertainment. A rare thing to ſee Princes converſe together with ſo much Freedom, and not kept aſunder with Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. King Chriſtiern made War againſt Sweden. In the year 1625. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Germany made him Head of the League againſt the Emperour Ferdinand the Second, for the Reſtauration of Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of the Rhine to his Eſtates. But he was ſuddenly beat out of all Jutland by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Imperialiſts, till he compounded the Buſineſs upon very good Terms, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to all his own. Afterwards he turned his Arms againſt the Swedes, in the year 1644, who got ſeveral Places from him; but the Peace put a ſtop to their Conqueſts. He reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixty years, and died at 70 years of age.</p>
               <p>Ann Catharine, his Queen, was Daughter of Joachim Frederick Elector of Brandenburg. He got by her, amongſt other Children, Chriſtiern and Frederick. Chriſtiern was choſen King of Denmark, in his Fathers life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. He was a very hopeful Prince, but unhealthy; ſo that he died before his Royal
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30793:49"/>Father, going to drink ſome Waters in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony. His Death made room for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> III, ſecond Son of Chriſtiern the Fourth. He was Archbiſhop of Bremen in Saxony, before he came to the Crown, upon the Death of his Royal Father, and not long after the deceaſe of Chriſtiern his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (as I ſaid before) was King elect. This is that magnanimous Prince, who by his invincible Conſtancy has not long ſince redeemed this Crown from the hands of the Swedes. This is that Frederick, whoſe late Calamities ſerved only to ſet off the greatneſs of his Courage. And, as if the ſame Rules of Providence were appointed for the Royal Families of England and Denmark, whilſt King Frederick was ſtruggling for his Crown with the Swedes, the late Uſurpers here kept the Crown from King Charles. And, as it was their fortune to ſuffer both together, ſo they had the Comfort to be both the ſame Year reſtored to their Dominions. 'Tis true King Frederick was fain to part with ſome of the beſt Jewels of his Crown. But that Loſs, whatever it is, is not Irrecoverable; and has already been ſufficiently made up on the part of his Subjects, by their deep ſenſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in making his Crown Hereditary, which formerly was but Elective. On the 18th of October 1643, ſome years before he came to the Crown, he married with the

Whereby he loſt to the King his Rights of Sovereignty over the Dukedom of Sleſwick, and has little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <head>Of the Nobility, Clergy, and Commonalty of Denmark, in relation to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; As alſo of the chief Order of Knighthood, called of the Elephant.</head>
               <p>IN all Governments the Inhabitants are diſtinguiſhed, and divided into ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Degrees, commonly called States. In England we have but King, Lords, and Commons. But in Denmark they reckon five Orders, or States; viz. the <hi>Blood-Royal,</hi> the <hi>Nobility</hi> or <hi>Gentry,</hi> the <hi>Clergy, Burgeſſes</hi> or <hi>Merchants,</hi> and <hi>Countrey-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our fore-going Diſcourſe we have ſpoke at large of the Blood-Royal. I come now to the next Order, which is the Nobility. A Bridle to Kings in all Elective Kingdoms, but on the contrary a Support of Crowns Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:30793:52"/>
               <p>Before the Crown of Denmark was made Hereditary, there was no Titular Lords. But he only was counted a Noble-man, that could ſhew his Nobility by a long Deſcent. They bore their Arms ſimple, and thought it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to change, or add to them. Here is ſtill the Noble Family of the <hi>Wrens,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors were preſent at the Treaty made on the River Eyder, between Charles the Great and Hening King of Denmark, which is almoſt 900 years ſince; As alſo that of the <hi>Whitfelds,</hi> of which the Engliſh <hi>Whitfields</hi> are an Off-ſpring, who bear the ſame Arms with the <hi>Whitfelds</hi> in Denmark, and whoſe Anceſtors came over with King Canute.</p>
               <p>To proceed, the Nobility or Gentry of Denmark (for 'tis the ſame thing there) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Eſtates with high and low Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have (as the German Counts) the liberty of Hunting, hair with hair, and feather with feather. Their Patrimonial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are not held in fief, but in free tenure. All Caſtles, Lands, and Goods, as well move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as immoveable, left to them by their Parents, are equally divided amongſt the Brothers. In caſe of Siſters, the Brother has two ſhares, and the Siſter but one. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Houſes and Caſtles are kept by the Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, but many Lordſhips are equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Noble-men, that are ſo well qualifi'd as to merit the King's ſpecial favour, may
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30793:52"/>come to great Preferment and Riches. 'Tis out of the Nobility that is choſen the Council of State, the Senators whereof muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the number of 38. The Crown allows each of them a Competency, with ſome fair Caſtle in the Countrey for his Retirements, whilſt he is of that Body.</p>
               <p>The Chief Men of this Council are the <hi>Ricks Droſt,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Marſhal, Admiral, Chancellour,</hi> and <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> The <hi>Ricks Droſt</hi> is, as it were, the King's Lieutenant, that manages, reſolves, and diſpatches the King's Affairs. The <hi>Lord Marſhal</hi> takes care both in Peace and War of all Military Concerns; and the <hi>Admiral</hi> ſees to Maritime Affairs. The <hi>Chancellor</hi> judges of Civil Cauſes, and the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> receives the King's Revenues.</p>
               <p>The third Order or Degree, is the <hi>Clergy.</hi> The Body of which does conſiſt of Miniſters, otherwiſe called the Inferiour Clergy. And out of theſe are choſen the Superintendents or Biſhops, for the Church-Government. Theſe are the Overſeers, Inſpectors, and Heads of the Clergy. Over which there is a general Superintendent, and that is the Biſhop (or Arch-biſhop, if you will) of Copenhagen. Theſe Governours of the Church have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Priority both of Place and Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other Miniſters, together with ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Maintenance in proportion to it. They have a Power of Preſidence in all Church-
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30793:53"/>Aſſemblies; but ſo, that they are to take along with them the Advice of other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. From whom they do not otherwiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, either in Order, Habit, or Title of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All of them in general, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are accountable to the Supream Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Conſiſtory, as in former times to the Provincial or National Synod. Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory is made up of Counſellors of State, and the Heads of the Clergy. In ſhort, both the Revenues and the Power of theſe Prelates are much Inferiour to what it was formerly before the Reformation; ſo that a Biſhop here is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better than <hi>Primus inter Pares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Order or Degree conſiſts of Townſmen, <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> who have their Privileges peculiar to themſelves. Out of theſe, and from the Husbandmens Children, are choſen the Biſhops, Canons, Miniſters, and Magiſtrates of Towns, Clarks of Caſtles and Fortreſſes, Ship-Officers, Toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. Theſe Magiſtrates judge the leaſt Cauſes, but for the moſt part they have a Preſident out of the Gentry.</p>
               <p>But, of all the Corporations within this Kingdom, none has ſuch Privileges, and truly none deſerves ſuch, as the City of Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. Privileges as to the Freedom of the City and the Increaſe of Trade. Privileges whereby the City has a Vote in all thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations which concern the publick Good.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30793:53"/>To which add their Privileges in purchaſing any Lands and Lordſhips whatſoever, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them with the ſame Rights as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; In not being burdened with any Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions the Nobles do not bear, and not that but by publick Conſent; in being free from all Contributions or Inquarterings whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in times of Peace; and laſtly, in that the Citizens Children, whether Eccleſiaſtick or Civil, are admitted to Honours and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices equally with Noblemens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, provided they be ſit and capable for them. All which Priviledges, and ſeveral others, the late King Frederick granted this City, when beſieged by Charles Guſtave of Sweden; that having the more to loſe, they might have moſt reaſon to defend themſelves, as they did effectually.</p>
               <p>The fifth Order or Degree is that of the <hi>Country-men.</hi> Which are of two Sorts, the one called <hi>Freibunden,</hi> that is Free-holders. Theſe enjoy their Living by Inheritance, but give ſome ſmall matter yearly. They trade alſo, and have the Liberty of Fiſhing. They are not taxed with Servitude or Bondage; neither pay they any Contribution, without the Conſent of the Senators and Counſellors of the Kingdom. The other Sort is of ſuch who have not any Land but what they farm of the King, Gentry, or Clergy; and are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30793:54"/>bound to do Homage for the ſame, as they make their Conditions.</p>
               <p>The chief Order of Knighthood in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is that of the <hi>Elephant.</hi> Inſtituted (as ſome ſay) <hi>Anno</hi> 1478. by King Chriſtiern I, at the Wedding of <hi>John</hi> his Son and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. The Badge of theſe Knights is a Collar powdred with Elephants towred, ſupporting the Kings Arms, and having at the end the Picture of the Virgin Mary.</p>

But the Breadth of it is not proportionable, the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt Parts (where it is broadeſt) not exceeding 300 miles in breadth from Eaſt to Weſt. From whence Northward it grows much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower. Weſtward it is bounded with the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Ocean; and Eaſtward with Sweden. Which, together with Norway, makes up that large and famous Peninſule by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called <hi>Scandia</hi> or <hi>Scandinavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, before we proceed to the deſcription of Norway, let us take a View of the <hi>Northern Ocean,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Frozen Sea,</hi> as being commonly clogged with Ice in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time. In which Senſe Pliny called it <hi>Mare Amalchium;</hi> Tacitus, <hi>Mare Pigrum;</hi> and the Cimbrians of old, <hi>Marimoruſa. Illuc uſque tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Natura,</hi> here is the end of Nature, ſays Tacitus ſpeaking of this Sea. Till the Engliſh found the way to Archangel in Moſcovy, this Sea was commonly look'd upon as Unnavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable. Now this North-eaſt Paſſage was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in King Edward the Sixth's time, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1553, under the Conduct of Richard Chancellour. For which Adventure three Ships were fitted out; but two of them periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cold, and all their Men were the next Year found frozen to death in their Ships.</p>
               <p>Along the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> the Sea runs much into Creeks and long Bays, and there is a World of Iſlands. But it is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30793:55"/>for that great and famous Gulf or Whirl-pool, called <hi>Maelſtroom,</hi> or <hi>Moske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroom,</hi> which lies between two Iſlands near the Coaſt of Norway.</p>
               <p>A Whirl-pool is a Collection of Waters turning ſwiftly about, and drawing to it ſelf whatever comes within ſome diſtance of it, and having whirled the ſame to the bottom, caſts it up again after a certain time. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which Stream, being ſo great, has a long time deterred Men from venturing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over it. So that Whirl-pools were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be unfadomable Abyſſes of Water. Nay, ſome would have 'em to be the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninal Cauſe of the Flux and Reflux; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in when the Water runs, it is Ebb, and when it runs out, Flood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>Tabula Geogr. Hydrogr.</hi> is of opinion, that the Sea runs down this Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool under the Land of Norway, and out again at another Whirl-pool within the Gulf of Bothnia, part of the Baltick Sea. And, to ſtrengthen this his Opinion, he ſays there is a high Rock in the midſt of the Stream, and under that Rock an Abyſs, through which the Water is ſwallowed. So that there ſhould be firſt a <hi>Vortex</hi> or Whirl-pol, and within it a <hi>Vorago</hi> or Gulf, that ſhould have its way under Norway, and its out-let within the Gulf of Bothnia.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:30793:56"/>
               <p>But Lucas Jacobſon Debes, a Daniſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thinks otherwiſe of it. He ſays, that where this Whir-pool lies the bottom of the Sea ariſes, and does not deſcend in deep Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; That the Whirl-pool proceeds from round Grounds with Channels or Conduits in them; That if there were any deep Ground to make a ſwallowing Gulf the Water ſhould not run about (as it does) in ſuch turbulent and boiſterous a manner as to be heard ſome Leagues off at Sea. And his Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtilleſt Waters have the deepeſt Bottom: But he ſays that great Noiſe is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the narrowneſs of the Paſſage for the large Ocean to run through with the Tide to the Continent, and to fall back again into the main Sea. Beſides the round Grounds and Channels under Water, where the huge beating and running about of the Sea muſt needs make a terrible Noiſe.</p>
               <p>As to what Peter Clauſon writes, that what whole Trees that Stream draws in come out again rugged with torn Roots and Branches; 'tis probable enough that happens by reaſon of thoſe high, round, and ſharp Grounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the Trees are whirled about by the ſtrong Stream, ſo as to beat and wear off the Roots, Branches, Bark, and the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the Trunk thereof. Of which ſort of Trees, ſayes my Author, there comes many aſhore to Feroe and Greenland; Which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30793:56"/>would not be, if there were any pervious Gulf. For then the Hole would be large, and the Water run ſtill round about; and, when any thing came to the Gulf, it would quickly run through it without any damage. Moreover, 'tis obſervable, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who dwell on the Iſlands and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent about this Whirl-pool row out upon it when the Weather is good, and the Stream ſlow in its reflux, and that they catch there abundance of Fiſh called Sey. Which they would not venture to do, if there were ſuch a thing as a devouring <hi>Vorago.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet there may be too a Receptacle, or deep Hole, near the high Rock which is in the midſt of the Stream; to receive and keep what the Stream draws in from time to time, and reſtore it when it runs out again. As for the Rock, it ſtands in the midſt of the Stream, as a Beacon for Sea-men, that they ſhould not come into danger.</p>
               <p>The Northern Ocean being exceeding deep, and therefore a fit Habitation for <hi>Whales;</hi> the Shores of Norway are not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled with thoſe great Leviathans. Againſt whoſe violence and fury the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and People of the Sea-coaſt have found a Remedy; that is <hi>Caſtoreum,</hi> or the Oyl of Caſtor, the ſmell whereof forces them to retire immediately. Otherwiſe there were no Fiſhing on theſe Coaſts, which is one of the greateſt ſtaple Commodities that the Country yields.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:30793:57"/>
               <p>Caſtoreum, or the Oyl of Caſtor, has the Virtue to drive the dead <hi>Foetus</hi> out of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb; and ſo it has to drive down a Whale, which no ſooner ſmells it but it ſinks to the bottom. The Whale has an acute Scent, and doubtleſs there is a great Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between the Whale and the Caſtoreum, for this to ſink ſo monſtrous a Creature, as ſoon as that comes within the reach of it's Smell. And therefore the Norway Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do ſeldom go a fiſhing without it.</p>
               <p>But, beſides Caſtoreum, there is a way to drive Whales with Juniper-wood, whereof the Fiſher-men cut Chips, and caſt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Whale. Which makes it preſently retire into the Deep. Now 'tis well known, that the Oyl of Juniper has the ſame virtue as the Caſtoreum to drive out the <hi>Foetus;</hi> and by the ſame reaſon it may alſo be, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper Wood (whereof the Oyl is prepared) drives down the Whale. From whence ſome Authors conclude, that all other Medicaments, and their Ingredients expelling the dead <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> may have alſo the virtue to drive down the Whale. Such as Aſſa foetida, Myrrha, Galbanum, Scammony, Brimſtone, Mace, Cinnamon, Rue, Mother-wort, and ſeveral others.</p>
               <p>And, as it has been proved by Experience, that a Perſon who could ſwim well was drowned, having Caſtoreum about him,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30793:57"/>whilſt others that were in the Boat, and could not ſwim, ſaved their Lives; ſo 'tis poſſible that the aforeſaid Species have the ſame vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the depreſſion of a Man. And, of ſo many Men that have ſuddenly loſt their Lives in the Waters, 'tis poſſible ſome of them were drowned by the virtue of ſome of thoſe Things aforeſaid, (eſpecially Mace and Cinnamon) which perhaps they had about them.</p>
               <p>But, to come home from my Digreſſion, Norway is a Countrey for the moſt part Rocky, and Mountainous. And here is a vaſt Ridge of Hills, called <hi>Sevo,</hi> the Alps of the North. They ſerve for the moſt part as a Boundary to Norway and Sweden, and are called in Norway <hi>Daare-field;</hi> but in ſome Parts of it, as in the Government of Dront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem, <hi>Skarsfield, Rund-field, Dofre-field;</hi> and betwixt Berghen and Aggerhuis, <hi>Fille-field,</hi> and <hi>Houckle-field.</hi> There are in this Country a great many Lakes; but ſcarce any great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, except in the South Parts.</p>
               <p>As the Country is Rocky and Mountainous, ſo it is barren, woody, extream cold, and but ill inhabited. In the beſt Parts thereof it affords little Corn; and in the moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, none at all. So that the common ſort of People are fain to uſe dried Fiſh, that which we commonly call Stock-Fiſh, inſtead of Bread; but the better ſort buy Corn of ſuch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30793:58"/>Merchants as come to traffick with them. Their chief Commodities are Stock-fiſh, Furs, Train-Oyl, Pitch, Tackling for Ships, and Timber for Building. Which the Inhabitants exchange for Corn, Wine, Brandy, Beer, and other Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Mercator, and Heylin after him, tells us, that this Country is exceedingly troubled with certain little Beaſts, which they call <hi>Lemmers.</hi> They are about the bigneſs of a Field-mouſe, and are thought by the Inhabitants to drop out of the Clouds in ſtormy Weather. They, like the Locuſts, devour every green thing on the Earth, and at a certain time die all in heaps together. The Stench whereof does ſo poiſon the Air, that the poor People are long after troubled with the Jaundice, and with a Giddineſs in the Head. Here is alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Wolves,</hi> and amongſt them ſome white Bears of a prodigious Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The Towns here are exceeding thin, and in them the Houſes for the moſt part very poor and miſerable.</p>
               <p>The Country in general is diſtributed into five Governments, according to the number of the Caſtles which command the ſame. Thoſe are the Governments of <hi>Bahuis, Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerhuis, Bergenhuis, Dronthemhuis,</hi> and <hi>Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:30793:58"/>
               <p>The Government of <hi>Bahuys</hi> is the moſt Southern of all, and lies oppoſite to the North Parts of Jutland in Denmark. The ſame is ſo called from <hi>Bahuis,</hi> a ſtrong Caſtle in this Province, in a ſmall Iſland which the River Trolhetta makes, that comes from the great Lake called Wener. 'Tis within three Leagues of the Sea, and two North of Gottenburg. The ſame was built <hi>Anno</hi> 1309, by Aquin II, King of Norway. And this is the Prefecture, or Government, which was yielded to the Swedes by the Roſchild Treaty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1658.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aggerhuis,</hi> the Caſtle, is ſituate about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues full North from Scagen, the moſt Northern point of Jutland. This Caſtle has under its Command, amongſt other Towns, <hi>Opſlo,</hi> a Biſhops See, and of moſt eſteem for the Courts of Judicature which are kept here. In the year 1646. a Gold Mine was found near this Town, but it fell ſhort of People's expectations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bergenhuis,</hi> another of theſe Caſtles, is ſo called from <hi>Bergen,</hi> the principal Town of the Country, an Epiſcopal See under the Archbiſhop of Dronthem, and the ordinary Reſidence of the Viceroy. This Town is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate amongſt high Mountains, at the bottom of a deep Creek, or Arm of the Sea, called Carmeſund; all which makes Bergen to be a very good Port, and accordingly much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to by Merchants. Ninety miles South
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30793:59"/>of Bergen, and under its Juriſdiction, you will find <hi>Stafanger,</hi> a Sea-Town with a good Port, near which is the Fort called <hi>Doeſwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dronthemhuis</hi> is ſo called from <hi>Drontheim,</hi> a Town ſeated upon a long Arm of the Sea, which reaches a great way into the Continent. The ſame is furniſhed with a ſafe and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Port, but of difficult acceſs. Once a famous Place, when it was the Seat of the Norvegian Kings, and an Arch-biſhops See; but now reduced to a Burrough, ſince the Subjection of this Countrey to the Danes. For it has no Walls about it, but lyes open on all ſides. 'Tis true, it has been deſtroy'd ſeveral times by fire, and there is ſtill to be ſeen ſome Remains of one of the moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Churches in the North. But this Place could never recover it ſelf to any thing of its ancient Greatneſs or Splendour, ſince the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Viceroys kept their Reſidence at Berg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen, as a more convenient Place, and to be ſure not ſo extreme cold as the other. For, whereas Drontheim is ſituate in the 24th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Northern Latitude (a cold Seat for a King, or a Vice-Roy) Bergen is at leaſt two degrees more Southerly. To be ſhort, Drontheim is that Place which the Latines called <hi>Nidroſia,</hi> as the Italians call it ſtill to this day. And they termed it <hi>Nidroſia</hi> from <hi>Nider,</hi> a River which runs before it. There is a Caſtle to defend it, but none of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:30793:59"/>
               <p>And yet it is the largeſt Prefecture, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reaching from South to North, no leſs than 500 miles; and from the Ocean Weſtward to the Kingdom of Sweden Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at leaſt 100 miles. 'Tis true, this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by reaſon of its great Extent, is ſubdivided into the Prefecture of Drontheim properly ſo called, which takes up the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Parts; and the Prefecture of Salte, which takes up the North Parts. The Whole, by the Roſchild Treaty, was granted to the Swedes; but afterwards reſtored to the Danes, by the next Treaty of the year 1660.</p>
               <p>Eaſt of Drontheim lyes the Countrey of <hi>Jempterland,</hi> formerly part of Norway, and as ſuch belonging to the Crown of Denmark. But, by the Treaty of Bromsbroo, <hi>Anno</hi> 1645, it was yielded to the Swedes, to whom it has been ſubject ever ſince.</p>
               <p>At laſt we come to <hi>Wardhuis,</hi> a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſartheſt Parts Northward. So cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Town of Wardhuys, as that is from the Iſle Ward (about 120 miles South-Eaſt of the North-cape) in which it is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Place, which was but formerly mean and poor, is ſomething improved ſince the North-Eaſt Paſſage to Archangel was found out by the Engliſh, it lying in the way for the Engliſh and Dutch to touch at, as they go to Moſcovy. But, by reaſon of the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Cold, and long abſence of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30793:60"/>Sun for ſome Months together, it is hardly habitable, and conſequently the Sea not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable. In the Summer time the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour makes ſhift to reſide in it, but paſt that Seaſon he ſhifts to a warmer Place. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was ſtrongly fortify'd by King Frederick the Second, as well to command the Natives, as to awe the neighbouring Laplanders. For Eaſtward this part of Norway borders upon the Moſcovian; Southward, upon the Swediſh Lapland. And truly this Government, at leaſt the Eaſt part of it (otherwiſe known by the name of <hi>Finmark</hi>) may be called the <hi>Daniſh Lapland.</hi> Here is the great Lake <hi>Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak,</hi> which parts a great way this Region from the Moſcovian Lapland.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Norvegians</hi> were formerly ſo warlike a People, that they became terrible to the more Southern Nations. By whom they were called <hi>Normans,</hi> q.d. <hi>Northmen,</hi> being at that time a mixture of ſeveral Nations of the North, as of Norvegians and Swedes, amongſt whom perhaps the Danes did come in. In ſhort, 'tis from them that the fair Province of Normandy in France took that name. For, as the Romans had been routed there by the French, ſo the French afterwards were routed by the Normans. Who, about the year 800, began their Irruptions out of their Northern Countreys; and did ſo ranſack and plague
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30793:60"/>the Maritime Towns of France and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, that it was inſerted in the Litany, <hi>From Plague, Peſtilence, and the Fury of the Normans, good Lord deliver us.</hi> Charles the ſimple, to quiet them, and to ſecure himſelf, gave them a part of <hi>Neuſtria</hi> (from them ſince called <hi>Normannia,</hi> or Normandy) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Sovereignty of Britanny, enjoy'd by them and their Poſterity for many Ages. Their firſt Duke was <hi>Rollo, Anno</hi> 912, from whom, in a direct Line, the ſixth was <hi>William</hi> called the Conquerour, and crowned King of England, <hi>Anno</hi> 1067.</p>
               <p>But, ſince the Norvegians became ſubject to the Crown of Denmark, their Fury is ſo much abated, and their Spirits have been ſo quelled, that they are grown as cold as their Climate. Inſtead of Invading Nations, they are given to Hoſpitality; and, far from turning Pirates, they are become great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrers of Theft. In ſhort, they have now the repute of being a ſort of good harmleſs People, without any fraud or deceit. For which they are indebted to the Danes; who, by keeping them low, have not onely took away their Strength, but their Courage. And yet it is ſaid, ſome of them are much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Witchcraft; and that they are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in it, as to be able, by keeping good Correſpondence with the Prince of the Air, drive a Trade of Winds.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:30793:61"/>
               <p>As to Chriſtianity, the Norvegians did not imbrace the Goſpel till the Reign of Olaus, Son of Sueno, King of Denmark and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that is about the Year 1055. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh aſſiſted in the Work; and the good King Olaus was ſo zealous in it, that he was cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized for a Saint, after his deceaſe. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was wrought here at the ſame time, and in the ſame manner, as it was in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>
               <p>I ſaid from the beginning, that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegians were firſt conquered by Sueno King of Denmark. In whoſe Line that Crown continued, till Sueno II reſtored it to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegians. But afterwards, being reunited to the Crown of Denmark, by the Marriage of Aquin King of Norway, and of Margaret eldeſt Daughter of Waldemar III, King of Denmark, it has ever ſince continued ſubject to this Crown. And, though Olaus, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son of Aquin, died without Iſſue; yet the Norvegians liked the Danes ſo well, that they never offered to aſſert their Liberties. But, if their ſtomachs ſerved them now to ſtir againſt the Danes, where is their ſtrength to do it? They are poor, and only fit to live (as they do) in an entire ſubmiſſion to their Prince, the King of Denmark; and under Him, to his Viceroy, the Lord Guldenlew.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Earldom of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> is a fine Eſtate in the North-Parts of Weſtphaly; ſo called from <hi>Oldemburg,</hi> the chief Place of it, and the Head of this Earldom. It lies betwixt the German Ocean Northward, and the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Munſter, Southward; the Dukedom of Bremen, Eaſtward; and Eaſt-Friſeland, Weſtward.</p>
               <p>The Soil hereof is exceeding rich, but in Paſtures eſpecially. Which breed infinite Herds of Cattel, and furniſh not this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try only, but ſome of their German Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and many of the more Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with Horſes, Beeves, Sheep, Swine, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Cheeſe. Here is alſo good ſtore of Pulſe, Barley, and Oats, plenty of Fruits, and Trees of all ſorts; large Woods, well ſtored with Veniſon, and yielding unto the Gentry the Delights of Hunting. But the Air is pretty cold in Winter, and foggy nigh the Sea. And this is the general Character Mercator and Heylin give us of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:30793:62"/>
               <p>Eaſtward it is watered with the River We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, which parts it from the Dutchy of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and is one of the chief Rivers of all Germany. Some miles to the Weſtward you will find the <hi>Jade,</hi> a River which at firſt was but a Brook ſcarce worth the naming. It ſprings out of a Pool or Lake, called the great Meer, and by the way parting (as it were) the Fields from one another, it ſwelled with the Waters that ran into it, and ſo fell into the Meers. At laſt the Banks breaking, through the violence of the Storms, it drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the lower Grounds, and made a great Collection of Waters at the Rivers Mouth, which makes it look more like a Gulf than a River. On this Shore are ſtill to be ſeen the ſad Remainders of ſeven or eight Pariſhes, that periſhed in this Flood.</p>
               <p>The chief Towns hereof are <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt.</hi> The firſt is ſcated on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Hont, twenty five miles Weſt of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and forty Eaſt of Embden; which Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver falls into the Weſer, about twelve miles from Oldenburg Eaſtward. The Town it ſelf is of no great State, or Beauty. But the Caſtle, where the Earls of Oldenburg dwelt, is ſtill a very good Caſtle, built of well-hewn Stones, of an orbicular form, with deep Ditches of Water about it. This is the Caſtle which Walpert, the firſt Earl of Oldenburg, built about the Year 850, calling it (from his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30793:62"/>Wife Alteburg) <hi>Alteburgum,</hi> which by the Germans was turned into <hi>Oldemburg.</hi>

                  <hi>Delmenhorſt</hi> is ſo called from the River Delme, on which it is ſituate, about three Leagues to the Weſtward of Bremen. 'Tis a ſtrong Place, and of great Importance, built in the Year 1247. by Otho, Brother of Earl Chriſtian the Second. But in the time of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Earl hereof (a Prince of an unquiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, always in Wars and always worſted) this Place was loſt to the Biſhop of Munſter.

               <p>Adjoyning to this Province is the Earldom of <hi>Jevern;</hi> ſo called from <hi>Jevern</hi> the chief Place hereof. This Earldom formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Princes of Eaſt Friſeland, and to this day moſt Geographers do ſtill reckon it as part of that Country; where it lies Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30793:63"/>towards the Sea. The ſame was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by the laſt Will and Teſtament of the Lady Mary, Counteſs of Jevern, to John the laſt Earl but one of Oldenburg. So that upon the Death of Anthony (the laſt Earl) dying without Iſſue, the King of Denmark, as being the next Heir, did inherit the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Eſtate. But the Earldom of Jevern fell to the ſhare of Anthony's Siſter's Children, the Princeſs of Zerbſt.</p>
               <p>Now, to go farther than we have done yet into the Pedigree of the preſent Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Denmark, let us take a view of the Earls of Oldenburg, from whom it is deſcended. The Houſe of Oldemburg fetches its Pedigree as far as <hi>Walpert,</hi> a Nephew of Wittikind. Now Wittikind was the laſt King of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons; who being vanquiſhed by Charles the Great of France, <hi>Anno</hi> 785, was by him made of a King a Duke of Saxony. But the Male Iſſue of Walpert his Nephew failing in Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, the ſeventh Earl, the Eſtate came to one <hi>Elimar,</hi> a Couſin German of his by the Fathers ſide. From whom in a direct Line deſcended</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodorick,</hi> ſurnamed the Fortunate, the firſt Earl of Delmenhorſt of this Line. He had two Wives, the firſt called Adelais, Heireſs of Delmenhorſt; and the ſecond, Hedwige, Daughter of Gerard and Siſter of Adolph of Scaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:30793:63"/>Earl of Holſtein and Duke of South Jutland, &amp;c. the Widow of Balthazar Duke of Mecklemburg. He died <hi>Anno</hi> 1440, leaving three Sons, <hi>viz. Chriſtiern, Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Gerard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1440. <hi>Christiern,</hi> Son of Theodorick by his ſecond Wife Hedwige, Siſter and Heir of Gerard and Adolph Dukes of Sleſwick and Earls of Holſtein, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father in this Eſtate, and enjoy'd it till the Year 1448. When, upon the Recommendation of Adolph his Uncle, being elected King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, he left his Eſtate in this Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (but ſtill reſerving the Title) to his Brother <hi>Gerard,</hi> the better to take him off from his Pretenſions to the Dukedom of Sleſwick and the Earldom of Holſtem, in which he pretended a Share. <hi>Maurice,</hi> Batchelour of the Sorbonne and Canon of Bremen, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Year 1458, and died <hi>Anno</hi> 1464, having had three Children, who all died in their Infancy.</p>
               <p>1448. <hi>Gerard,</hi> the third Son of Earl Theodorick, was ſurnamed the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; and might as well have been called, in oppoſition to his Father, the Unfortunate, for the Reaſons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. <hi>Anno</hi> 1453. he marry'd with Adelais Counteſs of Tecklemburg, by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:30793:64"/>whom he got five Sons and as many Daughters. Thoſe were <hi>Gerard, Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick, Adolph, Otho,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard, the Father, died in Exile, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1500.</p>
               <p>1500. <hi>John,</hi> who ſucceeded him, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in the Year 1498. to Ann a Princeſs of the Houſe of Anhalt. By whom he got three Sons, <hi>George, Chriſtopher, Anthony,</hi> and one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called <hi>Ann,</hi> marry'd to Enno the Second, Earl of Eaſt Friſeland. John repaired the Ruines of his Eſtate, and ſettled the Diſtractions of it in the time of his Father, being then in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile.</p>
               <p>1526. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the third Son, was by the Conſent of his Brothers prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Earldom. He marry'd Sophia, Dutcheſs of Saxen Lawem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; by whom he got two Sons, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Ann, Catharine,</hi> and <hi>Claire.</hi> This is the Earl, who by a ſudden Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe recovered Delmenhorſt from the Biſhop of Munſter, <hi>Anno</hi> 1547, which he ſtrongly fortify'd.</p>
               <p>1573. <hi>John,</hi> Son of Anthony, marry'd with Elizabeth, Daughter of Count Schwartzburg, by whom he got two Sons, and four Daughters. His Sons
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30793:64"/>were <hi>John Frederick,</hi> who died in his Infancy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580, and <hi>Anthony-Gontier.</hi> His Daughters were 1. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> marry'd to Auguſtus Duke of Saxony; 2. <hi>Anna Sophia;</hi> 3. <hi>Mary-Elizabeth;</hi> 4. <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the Wife of Rodolph of Anhalt Prince of <hi>Zerbſt.</hi> This is the Earl to whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of Jevern in Eaſt Friſeland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony Gontier,</hi> ſecond Son of Earl John, was his Succeſſor. He was born in Nov. <hi>Anno</hi> 1583, marry'd in June 1634 or 35. Sophia Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina, Daughter of Alexander Duke of Holſtein Sunderburg, and died without Iſſue in the Year 1667. At which time Frederick, the late King of Denmark, took Poſſeſſion of Oldenburg, as next Heir to it.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much of Oldenburg, let us now ſteer our Courſe Northward, and ſee what Dominions the King of Denmark has there, beſides the Kingdom of Norway.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Iſles of <hi>Schetland,</hi> and of <hi>Feroe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore I come to a Deſcription of theſe Iſles, it will not be improper to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in our way of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonged to the Kings of Norway and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:30793:65"/>Denmark. They were called <hi>Orcades</hi> by the Ancients, which we call now the <hi>Orkney</hi> Iſlands. Situate North of Scotland, not far from Cathneſs, the moſt Northern Country of all that Kingdom; and ſeparate from one another by ſome narrow Streights. They are in number thirty two, but thoſe of chief note eleven.</p>
               <p>The Kings of Notway held theſe Iſles till the Year 1266; when Magnus, King of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſurrendred them up to Alexander III. King of Scotland. Which Surrender ſome of the ſucceeding Kings did afterwards ratifie. But the Claim was finally relinquiſhed by Chriſtiern I, King of Denmark and Norway, on the Marriage of his Daughter Margaret with King James III, <hi>Anno</hi> 1474. And then ſome Money was added to make good the Contract, without which the Danes would not give up their Claim to theſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Further Northward, about ſixty miles, lye the Iſlands of <hi>Schetland</hi> and of <hi>Feroe,</hi> all of them ſtill ſubject to the Crown of Norway, and conſequently to the King of Denmark.</p>
               <p>The Iſles of Schetland lye North-eaſt of the Orcades; and the Iſles of Feroe, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt. But the Situation of theſe laſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further Northward.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are under the 61 and 62 degrees of Northern Latitude, about 60 Leagues Weſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30793:65"/>of Bergen in Norway, and forty North of Scotland. By Cluverius, Sanſon, and other Geographers, they are ſuppoſed to be the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes</hi> of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>One with another they are reckoned to be about twenty ſix. But they are moſt of them little rocky Iſlands, uninhabited.</p>
               <p>The main Iſland, and that which is worth all the reſt, is <hi>Schetland,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Hetland,</hi> which gives its Name to the whole Cluſter. But it goes alſo, like the chief of the Orcades, by the Name of <hi>Mainland.</hi> 'Tis a long, but narrow Iſland; reaching from South to North about ſixty miles, and ſixteen where broadeſt. This Iſland is not much inhabited but by the Sea-ſide, becauſe of Fiſhing, which is the main Thing here. Southward there are high Hills, and Northward there's another, called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisfelt, on the top of which is kept a great Light for the uſe of Mariners.</p>
               <p>As the Inhabitants are not very induſtrious, ſo they are not much inclined to Vices. 'Tis ſeldom they drink any ſtrong Liquors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and, when they do, 'tis as rare to ſee one of them mad-drunk. For Quarrelling does not attend their Drinking. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this their Temperancy, as much as the wholſomneſs of the Air, or the nature of the Country, makes them to live ſo long as they do. Mercator makes mention of one Laurentius, a Native of this Iſland, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30793:66"/>in his time. This Man, ſays he, being above 100 years of Age, was yet ſo vigorous that he marry'd a Wife; and, when he was 140 years old, ſtill he went with his Boat a fiſhing in a moſt unruly, tempeſtuous, and turbulent Sea.</p>
               <p>The great Diſpute amongſt the Learned is, whether Schetland or Iſeland is the <hi>Thule</hi> of the Ancients. <hi>Thule</hi> which the Poets do ſo often ſpeak of; as Virgil, <hi>Tibi ſerviat ultima Thule,</hi> and Seneca, <hi>Nec ſit Terris ultima Thule. Thule,</hi> which the Ancients did report ſuch ſtrange things of, and ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all belief. <hi>Nulla per bruman dies,</hi> ſays Pliny, here's no day for all the Winter; with whom agree Solinus, and many others, as to that particular. Another ſays more than that, <hi>nullum ultra eam diem eſſe,</hi> that beyond this Iſle there was no day in any Place, as if here had been the end of the World and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But Pytheas in Polybius go's beyond them all, when he ſays that in this Iſle there was no diſtinction of the Elements; but a confuſed Mixture of all together, like the Primitive Chaos of the Poets.</p>
               <p>According to theſe Authors, 'tis neither Schetland nor Iſeland that can be the <hi>Thule</hi> of the Ancients; and 'twere a hard matter to find out ſuch a Place in any part of the known World. But it is no new thing for remote Places to be ſtrangely repreſented.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:30793:66"/>
               <p>When all is done, I am apt to be of Dr. Heylins Opinion, who takes Schetland to be the <hi>Thule,</hi> for theſe Reaſons following. Firſt Ptolomy places <hi>Thule</hi> in the 63 degree of Northern Latitude, who differs therein but in one Degree (or there abouts) from the beſt of our modern Maps. Whereas Iſeland is ſo much further North, that a good part of it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Arctick Circle. Pomponius Mela places <hi>Thule</hi> oppoſite to Bergen in Norway; which Situation agrees with that of Schetland, but not Iſeland. <hi>Multae ſunt,</hi> ſays Solinus, <hi>circa Britanniam Inſulae, è quibus Thule ultima,</hi> there are many Iſlands about Brittain, of which <hi>Thule</hi> is the laſt, or fartheſt off. So that in his Judgment <hi>Thule</hi> muſt be one of the Brittiſh Iſles, which cannot be ſaid of Iſeland. <hi>Inſulas quas Orcadas vocant domuit, deſpecta eſt Thule,</hi> ſay's Tacitus ſpeaking of Agricola, he ſubdued the Iſland called Orcades, and made ſleight of <hi>Thule.</hi> Now Iſeland is ſo far from being kenned by any one of the Orcades, that it is almoſt 5 degrees diſtant from the neareſt of them. And the truth is, Iſeland was ſo far from being known unto the Ancients, that it was hardly known unto thoſe of Norway till about the ninth Century. To which add Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Peucerus his Obſervation, that Schetland is by ſome Mariners called <hi>Thylenſel,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the name of <hi>Thule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all theſe Arguments, who can almoſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30793:67"/>doubt but that Schetland (not Iſeland) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Thule</hi> of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>But, beſides Schetland (or Mainland) there are two other Iſlands North-Eaſtward, of a pretty bigneſs; viz. <hi>Zell,</hi> and <hi>Wuſt,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Yell</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Iſlands and the reſt being much of the ſame nature and conſtitution as thoſe of Feroe, I ſhall not ſtay to give you a particular Account of thoſe of Schetland, but proceed to thoſe of Feroe. Which, as wild as they are, will find us more diverſion and variety than far better Countries. And therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to dwell here a while, under the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal guidance and conduct of a Daniſh Author, <hi>Lucas Jacobſon Debes,</hi> Maſter of Arts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of the Churches there. A Man of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in all likelihood of as great Integrity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſlands of Feroe</hi> lye Weſtward from thoſe of Schetland, and ſomthing more Northward. The heigth of the Pole or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude thereof is at the South end 61 degrees 15 minutes, and at the North end 62 degrees 10 minutes. So that there is but little night in Summer. Neither are the Winter nights ſo tedious long as one might imagine, becauſe the <hi>Crepuſculum</hi> and <hi>Diluculum</hi> are ſomthing long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er here than elſewhere, which takes off much from the night. For in the midſt of Winter one may perceive ſomething of the day at
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30793:67"/>eight a clock in the Morning, and at four a clock at Night.</p>
               <p>The name of <hi>Feroe,</hi> by which theſe Iſlands are called, is probably derived from a Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Word which anſwers to our <hi>Ferry.</hi> Now Feroe conſiſting of many Iſlands, where one muſt croſs with Boats and Ferries, 'tis likely enough that from thence this Land might be called Feroe.</p>
               <p>When Grimar Camban, a famous Pirate or Sea-robber, came firſt to theſe Iſlands, he found them uninhabited. And the truth is in thoſe times, when Piracy was honourable, the very Orcades, as well as the Iſles of Schetland, were but the Manſions of Robbers and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. But in the Reign of Pulcricomus, King of Norway, many conſiderable Men, with their Wives and Children, Goods and Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, took their Habitation in the Feroe Iſlands, which Name was then known in Norway.</p>
               <p>They are in number 17 inhabited Iſlands, beſides ſeveral Holmes, or Iſlets. Amongſt which theſe are the largeſt, viz. <hi>Stromoe</hi> and <hi>Oſteroe</hi> Northward, then <hi>Suderoe</hi> Southward. Next to which in bigneſs you will find North-Eaſtward, <hi>Calſoe, Cunoe, Bordoe, Videroe, Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, Fuloe;</hi> then Weſt of Stromoe, <hi>Waagoe;</hi> and betwixt Stromoe and Suderoe, <hi>Sandoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Whole extends it ſelf from North to South about 60 miles; and from Eaſt to weſt 40.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:30793:68"/>
               <p>The Inhabitants talk of a <hi>Floating Iſland,</hi> that their Anceſtors and themſelves have ſeen during ſome Hours, on the North of theſe Iſlands. Where they diſcerned Hills and Dales on it, and running Rivers gliding through the green Valleys. Perhaps it might be the ſame which Paul Badſted, a Skipper, diſcovered in April <hi>Anno</hi> 1611, about eleven Leagues South-eaſt of Feroe Iſlands. Who, together with two Clergy-men that came along with him to Feroe, related how being by ſtormy Weather driven out of their courſe to the South thereof, perceived an Iſland; and how being come near it they ſaw it perfectly, green with Graſs towards the Sea-ſide, with Rocks and Clifts near the Land. They ſaw Rivers running through the Iſland with high Hills and Promontories, not unlike in all Circumſtances to the Iſlands of Feroe. But, perceiving no other Iſlands by it, they found themſelves to be deceived, and ſo made to the North. The Iſland of Enckhupſon found by the Hollanders under the 65 degree of Northern Latitude, 45 Leagues North-weſt of Feroe, ſeems to confirm that Opinion, ſince it is no more to be found.</p>
               <p>My Author leaves it modeſtly to every one's Judgment, whether ſuch a maſs of hard Rocks could float. If they were, ſays he, of the nature of a Pumice ſtone, it might be ſo; but then it would ever float. The Ancients
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30793:68"/>indeed did believe Delos a floating Iſland, till ſuch time as it gave Birth to Diana and to Apollo. As for floating Iſlands in freſh Water, grown together with Roots, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with looſe Earth, decked with Graſs, 'tis a Thing not to be deny'd. There was ſuch a one upon a Lake near Moſco, when I was there an Attendant on the Right Honourable the Earl of Carliſle, in his Embaſſy from the King to Czar of Moſcovy.</p>
               <p>Suinoe, one of the ſecond Rate Iſlands, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Inhabitants to have been a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſland; and they are of opinion, that if one could come to the Iſland that has been ſo often ſeen, and caſt a piece of Steel upon it, the Iſland would remain faſt. Which agrees with the Diver's ſuperſtitious Practice, who lay ſteel upon what they find at the bottom of the Sea, that Spirits may not remove it.</p>
               <p>My Author is a little Incredulous as to the point of floating Iſlands, and takes it for a meer Illuſion of the Devil. But, if a little Caſtoreum has the virtue to drive down a great Whale into the bottom of the Sea, why can't there be ſome ſecret Thing in Nature to bear up an Iſland floating?</p>
               <p>But, to come home to our Feroe Iſlands, they are in themſelves but high Rocks, riſing out of the Sea, and ſtrangely divided from each other by deep and rapid ſtreams of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 'Tis true the Valleys and the ſides of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:30793:69"/>Hills are almoſt every where covered about two foot thick of Earth; which produces abundance of Graſs, and not a little Corn.</p>
               <p>In Summer the <hi>Air</hi> is temperatly warm, not very hot at any time; neither is the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very cold, conſidering the Climate. It ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom freezes there a month together, neither is the Froſt then ſo hard as to produce Ice in the open Inlets. Wherefore all Horſe and Sheep keep the Fields during the whole Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſeldom come under ſhelter.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of ſuch mild Air is the Sea. Which, being warm both by its ſaltneſs and perpetual motion, does ever produce warm Vapours that temper the Air, and take away the rigour of its coldneſs.</p>
               <p>But then the Air being moiſt, and the Clouds watery, from thence proceed ſuch ſtrange Storms and terrible Winds, as if the Hills would be torn to pieces. Winds that ſometimes tear up the Stones from the ground, turn up the earthen Cruſt from the Rocks, and roll it together as one might a piece of Lead. Which ſtormy Winds are very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and come in terribly by Guſts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Gaps are between the Tops of the Hills, where the Winds gather and throng themſelves through with a wonderful Force. And yet ſometimes, during ſuch a Storm, (a Thing almoſt Incredible) thoſe that live in the Valleys under thoſe Mountains are in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:30793:69"/>ſo ſtill a condition, that you may go from one Houſe to another with a Light burning. But 'tis obſervable, that, before the ſaid impetuous Wind comes to blow at that furious rate, the Houſes crack and make a noiſe, as if they would fall down. Tho afterwards they are not much moved, even in the ſtreſs of Weather.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, there is no Place more ſubject to <hi>Whirlwinds</hi> than theſe Iſlands. Which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hills ſo high that the Wind can't blow ſtreight forwards, but now hits againſt one corner, then againſt another, and ſo againſt a third, it happens that thoſe ſtormy Winds meeting one another, ſtruggle (as it were) for Paſſage, and fight together. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time ſtormed about between the Hills, it comes down over the Inlets, where they whirl round about a great way into the Sea. In which caſe a Boat muſt preſently let fall its Sails, or elſe it is overturned. And Ships ſometimes have been loſt through thoſe Guſts from the Mountains.</p>
               <p>'Tis obſerved now and then on Land, that, when it is pretty good Weather, one of thoſe Whirlwinds will come on a ſudden ſo furious as to beat a Man down from his Horſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Man and Horſe, and ſtrike down thoſe that go on foot. But ſuch as are uſed to the Country can eaſily perceive its coming, by the terrible Buſtle it makes amongſt the Clifts, while it is ſtill Weather below. Then
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:30793:70"/>the Rider alights from his Horſe, and lays himſelf on the Ground.</p>
               <p>This is that ſort of Whirlwind which the Greeks called <hi>Eenephias,</hi> that is a Storm breaking out of the Clouds. Which happens often at the Cape of Good Hope. Where the People do no ſooner perceive a little Cloud over the Table-Mount (a certain Preſage of a terrible Whirlwind) but they run amain to their Ships, and drive 'em off from the Land, ſo to preſerve themſelves and their Shipping.</p>
               <p>The Story of Anderſon, a Prieſt of Suderoe (one of the chief Iſlands of Feroe) is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious a Story, that it is almoſt paſt belief. Travelling to Sumboe, one of his Pariſhes, he came to Sumboe Horſe, a Clift above 200 fathoms high. This Clift has ſeveral points, by reaſon of which (beſides the heighth of the Hill) whether the Wind blows to or from the Land, there may be cauſed a ſtrong Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. The Prieſt being come near the edge of the Promontory, there came a ſtrong Whirlwind, that took and carried away both Him and his Horſe. But a ſtronger Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, coming directly againſt it, threw him again on the Land, without any hurt.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo the Hurricane (or Whirlwind) ſo common in the Weſt Indies, and called in Greek <hi>Typhon.</hi> This is formed in the Clouds, from whence it ſtrikes down with ſuch a ſudden and mighty Whirl, that it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:30793:70"/>tears all to pieces. Sometimes out of the Land it takes up Trees, Buſhes, Stones, Fleſh, and what elſe it meets with; as out of the Sea, it draws up ſuch an incredible quantity of Water, as to make deep Cavity's in the Sea, till it runs together again. And what Fiſhes are then in that Water are drawn up by ſuch a Whirlwind, and let fall in another place. Thus it comes to paſs ſometimes, that it rains Stones, Fleſh, Mice, and in Norway their Lemmers. In Kolter, a ſmall Iſland on the Weſt ſide of Stromoe, there is a Hill at leaſt 200 Fathoms high; on the higheſt top of which a World of Herrings were found ſpread along. Theſe, without doubt, were carry'd by a Whirlwind thither; the Sea (when moſt boyſterous) ſeldom caſting any Fiſh on land. For, as in ſtormy Weather Birds hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Trees, Holes, and Neſts; ſo the ſmall Fiſhes, when the Sea grows too ſtrong for them, float on the Deep, to ſave themſelves there as long as the Storm laſts.</p>
               <p>The Winds that naturally blow here are Weſt and Southweſt, eſpecially in the Spring and Summer. And it frequently happens, that on the ſide of the Land where the Wind blows, there is Rain and bad Weather, whilſt on the other ſide 'tis fair and clear. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is the great height of the Land.</p>
               <p>Here is no <hi>Thunder</hi> in Summer, ſays my Author, but the other Seaſons are not free from it.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:30793:71"/>
               <p>In ſhort, the Air of Feroe is very wholſom, free from Peſtilence, Infection, and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſes. And how can it be otherwiſe where there is ſo much Wind and Thunder to purifie the Air? Beſides that a running Stream flows almoſt by every Man's Houſe, waſhing away all Impurities that might infect the Air. To which add the ſalt Vapours of the Sea, which keep the Air from Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Salt it ſelf keeps Bodies from Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>From the Air I proceed now to the <hi>Water.</hi> And the firſt that offers it ſelf to our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is the Sea, which ſurrounds theſe Iſlands on every ſide, and is ſometimes a Terror to them; as you may gueſs by the following Exemples. Kolter, the little Iſland aforeſaid, is expoſed on the Weſt ſide to the open Sea, and there is towards the Main a Promontory thirty Fathoms high. Yet the Sea does almoſt every Winter break over it with a Weſtern Wind, and that in ſuch Quantity, that the Inhabitants are ſometimes in danger of being drowned. On a corner of the ſame Promontory there lay formerly a large Stone ſix foot long, and four foot thick and broad. Which Stone the proud Sea tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about, and threw ſome Paces off from the place where it lay before. This my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor urges for a perfect Truth; a thing more to be wondred at than eaſie to conceive.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:30793:71"/>
               <p>After a great Storm, when the Fiſhers row out to fiſhing, the Sea is ſtill ſo agitated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that the Fiſhers ſometimes can ſee no Land.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tides</hi> are the ſame here as in other Places, where it ebbs ſix hours and flows the like ſpace of time. Yet their Courſe is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, according as they beat againſt the Rocks and Points of Land, and as the Ground is under them. Eaſtward the Water riſes but three Fathoms, but Weſtward it riſes ſeven, though the diſtance be but forty miles that way. And one may eaſily perceive the Sea to riſe higher at Weſt of Suderoe than at Eaſt; though the Land, where it is broadeſt, be not above eight miles broad.</p>
               <p>Between theſe Iſlands there run alſo many ſtrong <hi>Currents;</hi> and that in ſeveral manners, according as the Necks or Points of Land meet againſt the Streams, and according to the Situation of the ſaid Land. Which cauſes eſpecially in Winter, (when there is a Storm, and the Wind blows againſt the Tide) a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and turbulent Sea. For then the Sea does raiſe and tumble it ſelf about, and breaks ſo ſtrongly againſt the Land, that no Ship hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can get ſafe over, even where it is deep enough. Now theſe Grounds, with breaking Waves, are called <hi>Buffs</hi> in the Language of Feroe.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:30793:72"/>
               <p>And it is obſervable, that in bad Weather the Sea breaks three or ſeven times together, without ceaſing, and then reſteth ſome time. Therefore, when the Inhabitants come to a breaking Place, and muſt needs over it, they lye ſtill till the <hi>Buff</hi> has broken, and then get over it ſpeedily with their Boat.</p>
               <p>But the Sea breaks alſo in ſtill Weather, when it is very warm, or when there will be Froſt or Snow. Alſo, when a Boat goes over too near the Land.</p>
               <p>Which ſtrange Motion of the Sea has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to the Inhabitants to think, that the Sea is ſenſible, and that thoſe Breaking Places cannot endure the Iron of a Boat. But let us ſee in ſhort our Daniſh Writers Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Reflections upon it.</p>
               <p>As to the Seas breaking up a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of times, he looks upon't as an <hi>Arcanum Naturae;</hi> and only ſays that happens by the Providence of God, who has created all things according to Weight, Meaſure, and Number. And for the breaking of them againſt warm Weather, or againſt a North-Wind, and Snow, thus he ſtates the Caſe. All Motion, ſays he, that happens between the Elements and other Beings that have neither Senſe nor Life, does happen by a magnetical Sympathy or Antipathy. And this he proves by the Load-ſtone, by Antidotes, Metals, and Minerals. At laſt he concludes thus. Though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30793:72"/>the Elements, ſays he, are in their Nature ſo contrary to one another; yet the one will not (nor can) be without the other, ſuffering each other by a Temperature. And, when this is wanting, ſo that there be either exceſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then Nature ſuffers, and is moved by Antipathy. By which Reaſon this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Motion doth happen in the Water over thoſe Grounds called <hi>Buffs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is ſeen in Feroe, that in ſtill Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Air is warm, ſo that there ariſes a Fog from the Sea rendring the Air dusky, not only the Currents run much ſwifter and ſtronger than at other times, but alſo the Sea grows ſtormy, and the <hi>Buffs</hi> break. Which hapneth, becauſe of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy that is between Water and Warmth in its Exceſs, whereby Water ſuffereth in its Nature.</p>
               <p>So, when in Winter there will come a ſtrong Froſt and Snow, the Currents grow ſtronger, the Sea beats, and the Buffs ariſe, though it be never ſo ſtill Weather. The Reaſon is, becauſe cold Weather alters the temper of the Water, and takes off from its natural warmth. So that it cannot keep its innate fluidity; but muſt, contrary to its own nature, let it ſelf be changed to a ſtanding rigid matter, called Ice. Which Change this Element perceives before-hand, and accordingly moves it ſelf by the virtue of its magnetical Antipathy.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:30793:73"/>
               <p>But for the <hi>Buffs</hi> to break, when there comes a Boat over them, this perhaps has a far more hidden Cauſe. Though it may happen by a magnetical virtue of theſe Grounds about which they break. So that, the Loadſtone by its ſympathy attending the Iron of the Boat, the ſhallow Water not being able to indure it, riſes it ſelf upon it.</p>
               <p>As nature has wonderfully framed the Shell of a Snail, ſo ſhe forms the like figures in the Air for Whirlwinds, and in the Ground for Whirl-pools.</p>
               <p>Feroe, a Land of Prodigies, has no leſs than three Whirl-pools. The one, between theſe three North-Eaſt Iſlands, Videroe, Suinoe, and Bordoe, not very dangerous. The other South of Sandoe, dangerous when there is a Storm, or a ſtrong Stream. The third, at South of Suderoe, running about Sumboe Munk, very terrible and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of it ſelf, eſpecially when there is a Storm and a ſtrong Current. For then it draws to it ſelf, and ſwallows up whatever comes near it. Neither can a Ship avoid it, if ſhe approaches it too near; as I might bring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it. And yet, when it is ſtill Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a mild Sea, and the reflux of the Stream, folks will venture themſelves to fiſh thereon.</p>
               <p>John Jonaſon of Suderoe is ſaid to be the firſt that durſt undertake to row over this Whirlpool, and to fadom it. According to his Relation, there are four ſeveral round
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30793:73"/>Circles of Ground about it; with Channels between, and a deep hole in the middle. The uppermoſt Ground is from eight to twelve fathom deep; and the lowermoſt, from eighty to ninety.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt-ſide, where the Ground begins, there is a Gulf where the ſtream runs in as through a Sluce. And on the South-ſide of the Hole there ariſes out of the Water a Rock ten fathoms high, called <hi>Sumboe-Munk.</hi> with ſix leſſer Rocks North of that which riſe a little above the Water. On theſe Rocks the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs turns round, even as the Whirlpool; and is ſo ſpoiled, that afterwards it is of no uſe. To this purpoſe my Author makes mention of a Ship, which coming too near Sumboe-Munk, all the Compaſſes in the Ship were ſpoyled. And ſo had been the Voyage too, had not a Sea man of the Ship by chance had a Loadſtone, wherewith he touched the Compaſſes a new.</p>
               <p>As for freſh Water, 'tis a wonderful thing to ſee a Cluſter of ſuch ſmall Iſlands as theſe in the midſt of the Ocean ſo well furniſhed as they are with well-taſted and wholſom Water. So that there is ſcarce a Cottage but there runs along a Spring-water, a Rivulet or Brook; whoſe Water is generally colder in Summer than in Winter. And yet there is but one healing Spring, <hi>viz.</hi> in Oſteroe, the Water whereof is much warmer in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Water, and will keep a whole
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30793:74"/>Year without Corruption. But the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have no great occaſion for it, neither is it eaſy to come at. In the Iſland Suderoe there is a little Lake pretty high on the Mountain, that ebbs and flows with the Sea.</p>
               <p>Thus having done both with the Air and Water of Feroe, let us now take a proſpect of the <hi>Land.</hi> I ſaid before, that theſe Iſlands in themſelves are onely ſome high Rocks ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Sea, and covered with a thin portion of Earth, that is uſually not above two foot thick. Which portion of Earth do's not only produce a great plenty of Graſs, but of Corn.</p>
               <p>And indeed in ſeveral Places <hi>Graſs</hi> is found ſo plentiful, and withal ſo juicy, that Oxen feed thereon all the year round, and grow extreamly fat. As for the <hi>Corn,</hi> could the Land be tilled every where, as in other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it would go beyond other Countreys of the ſame bigneſs. But here a Countrey-man cannot ſow above one or two Tuns of Corn. Now for one Tun of Seed, in many places, they reap again twenty or thirty Tuns, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the South Iſlands. Here is nothing ſowed but Barley, for other Seeds will not come to maturity; and there being but little of that ſowed, there is the more ground for Paſtures.</p>
               <p>'Tis very remarkable, that the North and North-eaſt Parts are the moſt fruitful, and produce the fineſt Paſtures; as if the cold
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:30793:74"/>North or North-Eaſt Winds could cauſe more fertility than the South, or South-Weſt, which are warm and moiſt, as having more the Sun's aſſiſtance. And, whereas the old Grecians called the Weſt-wind <hi>Zephirus,</hi> as that which cauſed Life in Plants, here (as in Greenland) we find the contrary in Paſtures. Which may be attributed to the Saltpeter there is in North-Eaſt Rain and Snow. For Salt is a main Ingredient to make the Earth fertile; and 'tis well known that Dunghils, where the Urine of Cattel remains and rots, are beſt for dunging. In Feroe they uſually take Sea-weeds from the ſhore, and lay them on heaps to rot, therewith to dung their Ground, which then bears abundance of Corn.</p>
               <p>One would think, that in theſe Northern Iſlands thoſe Parts where the Sun ſhines moſt ſhould be the moſt fruitful. But it proves otherwiſe, thoſe Places that lye leſs open to the Sun being the moſt fertile. And indeed the fruitfulneſs of the Earth does not ſo much depend upon its being near the Sun, as from its own Conſtitution and natural warmth, by virtue whereof the Plants have their growing motion. The Sun's warming of the Earth in the Day-time would prove but fatal to Plants, if the Night did not cool and moiſten what the Sun has dry'd in the day. And in the Torrid Zone nothing could grow for the heat
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30793:75"/>of the Sun, if the Night there, being almoſt as long as the Day, did not by its Cooling and Dew qualifie the Day's ſcorching Heat. And 'tis obſervable, that here in the midſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when in two Months time there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no Night, Corn grows but very little though it rains, or Herbs though they be watered in dry weather. But, when the Nights begin to be longer, both Corn and Herbs grow more in a Night and Day, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in fourteen.</p>
               <p>As Denmark is praiſed for its Scurvy-graſs, Norway for its Gentiane and Chamaemorus, and Iſeland for its Angelica; ſo Feroe ought to bear the Prize for its <hi>Rhodian Root.</hi> Whoſe Water being diſtilled, is found in odour and taſte to be moſt like Roſe-water. Here grows alſo abundance of Tormentill, Scurvy-graſs, and Angelica. The firſt is made uſe of by theſe Iſlanders to tan their Hides with, they having no Bark of Trees.</p>
               <p>For here grow no <hi>Trees,</hi> but ſome Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrubs, and Willow-buſhes. Fruit-trees will not thrive here, becauſe perhaps of the Saline damps of the Sea. But for Fewel, this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is provided with abundance of <hi>Turf.</hi> Which is ſo rare good in ſome Places, that Smiths uſe it inſtead of Sea-coals to work their Iron with.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> 'tis likely there might be found ſome Copper and Iron Mines,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30793:75"/>by reaſon of ſome ſmall Rivulets running down the Hills in Summer, which are found to grow as green as Verdigreace in dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the North Iſlands there is <hi>Talk,</hi> but in very little quantity.</p>
               <p>On the Sand, near the Sea-ſide, there are found in ſome Places little tranſparent <hi>Stones,</hi> ſo hard that with them one may write upon Glaſs. They are generally white, or of a blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh white Colour; and ſo poliſhed, that they ſerve to put in Rings. They grow in the Clifts, and the Sea waſhes 'em off. Here is alſo to be found ſome Chryſtal, but brittle, and not to be wrought.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fairies Kidney</hi> (which ſome call a Stone, and others a Weſt-India Bean) is alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen here. 'Tis ſhaped like a Heart, or Kidney; and it has been the Opinion of ſome People, that being kept long it brings forth another Stone. According to my Author, it has a hard outward Shell of a Cheſnut co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with a ſweet Kernel within, and is brought hither by the Stream from ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where it falls off its ſtalk into the Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cattel</hi> of Feroe is for the moſt part lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but fat, according to the Ground it feeds on. The <hi>Horſes,</hi> as little as they be, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly ſtrong, ſure, and ſwift, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horſe-ſhooes. They feed abroad both Winter and Summer, without ever coming under ſhelter. The <hi>Cows</hi> likewiſe go often out
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30793:76"/>to Graſs the whole Winter, provided there fall not too much Snow. But the <hi>Sheep</hi> feed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad all the Winter over.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that in a hard Winter, when there falls a haſty and laſting Snow, they ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible hardſhip, eſpecially if the Shepherd be not preſent to drive them into the Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhelter; Which is a Place in the open fields (like a Fold) incloſed with fences of Earth and Turf againſt the North, that Sheep may ſhelter themſelves there. For then they gather themſelves cloſe together in the open field, where a great Snow ſoon covers them. So that ſometimes they are not to be found, and remain a whole Month under the Snow. Where they are fain to eat the graſs by the roots, and the Wool off of one another. The wild ones, that go often upon the edge of the Clifts over the Sea, run alſo a great hazard after a great Snow. For ſometimes the Snow tumbles down into the Sea, and they along with it, hundreds at once. Such Accidents as theſe fall heavy upon the Owners, conſidering that the Riches of theſe People do's moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Sheep.</p>
               <p>Which being half wild, and in ſome places quite wild, cannot caſily be driven into a Pound, but muſt be taken with Dogs. Now theſe Dogs are ſo taught, that when the Shepherd will have but one Lamb of the Flock for ſome occaſion, he goes into the fields
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30793:76"/>with his Dog; and what Lamb he only points at, the Dog takes the ſame preſently without hurting it. Theſe Dogs are long and ſmall, not unlike Grey-hounds; which being well taught, are much valued, becauſe of this Sheeps hunting. The Horſes alſo are ſo well skilled in it, that, when a Horſe overtakes a Sheep, he graſps it between his fore-legs, till the Man takes it up.</p>
               <p>As wild as theſe Sheep are, they ſeldom go from their Owner's Ground into another Man's, but keep cloſe together every flock by it ſelf, and that too in the ſame Cloſe, where it is uſual to have ſeveral Flocks. Northward they are generally white, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward black and coloured. A white Sheep ſet on Lille-Dimen (an Iſlet Eaſt of Suderoe) changes its colour, and grows black in proceſs of time; firſt about the Legs, then on the Thighs, after that under the Belly, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all over. The Cauſe whereof is perhaps in the Earth, there being found much Brimſtone and Saltpeter.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo great Plenty both of <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea-Fowls,</hi> ſome profitable, and others da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable; ſome not unlike ours in England, others we are ſtrangers to. But I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon them.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Venomous Beaſts,</hi> ſuch as Serpents and Snakes, there's none to be found here; the nature of the Earth being ſuch, that it cannot bear them.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:30793:77"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiſh</hi> they have in great plenty, ſuch as Whiting, Flounders, a kind of Pilchards they call Murt, and Cods. They take alſo in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time a world of <hi>Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>gs</hi> in their Vaults or Caves under the Clifts near the Sea, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they retire themſelves in September, to bring forth their young ones.</p>
               <p>To take them, firſt the Iſlanders have a peculiar ſort of ſmall Boats for to go into thoſe Caves with, and they uſually go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with two Boats. Whilſt the one goes in, the other ſtays without at the entrance of the Cave. Between the Boats there is a long Tow, of about eighty fathoms, that if the Boat which goes in ſhould be filled with Water (as it ſometimes happens) the other may pull it out with the People in it. The Cave being narrow, they have a pointed ſtake on each ſide, wherewith they thruſt themſelves in. And, that they may ſee to kill the Seals in ſo dark a place, they carry with them two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as thick as a man's Arm. Theſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles they hide in the Boat, till they be ready for execution. Being come ſo far in the Cave as to feel ground (which they try with their pointed ſlaves) firſt one man leaps out from the Boat into the water as deep as he can wade, with a Club in his hand, to fell the Seal-dog. Then leaps the ſecond man after him, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Candles in his hands as high as he can, that the water may not put them out.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30793:77"/>After them comes the third Man, with his felling Club. An old Seal, eſpecially if it be a He, will not flee from a Man, but ſtands it out ſtoutly. A ſhe is not ſo fierce, and flees from the Man, if ſhe can. The young ones ly all ſtill, and never take notice of men nor light, till they come and kill them.</p>
               <p>They all lye on dry ground, for they are Amphibious. And, when the old ones begin to ſee the Light and the Men coming at them, they riſe on their Paws, with their Jaws open, to meet the Blow with, or to do miſchief if they can. Thus ſtanding in their own defence, the firſt man comes on with his Club. And, whilſt the Seal-dog ſnatches his Club from his hands, and caſts it away, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man ſtrikes him with his Club over the Neck. If he hits him right, the Seal falls down in a Swoon, and preſently the Men cut his Throat. When they have done with the old, they come to the young ones, that lye all ſtill far enough from the Water. The Slaughter being over, they hale the dead Seals to the Water-ſide, and tye them faſt to the Rope, wherewith thoſe in the Boat pull them out of the Cave. That being done, the Men get out with their Boat; or, if the Waves be great, the Boat and Men are alſo haled out.</p>
               <p>In this manner they get ſometimes half a hundred Seals in one Cave, the old ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30793:78"/>twice as big as a Maſty Dog. They uſe their Skins for Shoes, melt the Fat into Train-Oyl, and eat the Fleſh of them.</p>
               <p>They have alſo a peculiar way to take <hi>Whales,</hi> eſpecially the ſmall ſort of them call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grind-Whales.</hi> Which ſometimes come in great Flocks under the Land in foggy Weather, or with the Tide in a dark Night, and running on the Lands ly dry when it is low Water. So that, when Folks come out in the Morning, all their Buſineſs is to ſeize upon and hale them away.</p>
               <p>But the beſt Sport is, when the Inhabitants muſt drive them into their Creeks or Inlets to catch them. For then the Country to be ſure muſt run, and be up in Arms. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they bring as many Boats together as they can, and their Whale-ſpears with them. They drive the Whale-flock before them, with great noiſe, and caſting of Stones. And, if there be occaſion, the Boats divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into two Squadrons, the one lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the form of a half-moon, to meet any Whale that would flee during the Slaughter; the other advancing into the midſt of the Flock, and thruſting their Whales-ſpears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Bodies. On the Land ſide there are Folks lying in an Ambuſh, till the Whales are come on Ground. Then they wade as deep as they can, and kill them with their Weapons. Which is done with ſuch
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30793:78"/>Fury on both ſides, that the Water takes the Tincture of Blood; and that does ſo blind the Whale, that ſhe cannot ſee to make her eſcape. Theſe Creatures, as ſtrong as they are, make little or no Reſiſtance; but only plunge as well as they can before the Boats and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till Death comes upon them. And then indeed they ſtrike ſo terribly about with their Tails, that ſometimes they beat the Boats to pieces, and the men are in great danger. Some of theſe Whales get again looſe from the Sands, and carry the Boats a great way with them on their Backs, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them full of Water, and ſometimes overturning them. But the Rear-Squadron of Boats drives them in again, unleſs they do plunge and dive ſo long away under Water, that they muſt let them go.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo another ſort of Whales, called <hi>Doglings,</hi> which is taken after an incredible manner. But the Inhabitants dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the great Whales, ſuch as the <hi>Roar</hi> and <hi>Witch-Whale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1664. there appeared, ſays my Author, a <hi>Whale-Dog,</hi> that is a Sea Monſter every way like a Dog, which ſwum about the Whales, between them and the Land. It was, ſays he, of a grey colour, hairy, and had long Ears like an Engliſh rough Spaniel. And in the Year 1670. there was ſeen Weſt of Suderoe a <hi>Mermaid</hi> cloſe by the Land, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:30793:79"/>two hours and a half. She ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right above the Water, having long Hair on her Head ſpread on the Water, and holding a Fiſh in her hand, with the Head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Feroe,</hi> they live along the Sea-ſide, and dwell where it is loweſt and moſt convenient for them to get to Sea with their Boats, and ply their Fiſhing. Which Places are ſcarce enough, there being almoſt every where high Promontory's, whence no Body can come down. Their Houſes are low built, and on all ſides well defended with thick Walls, made of green Turf and Stones. They have a great many Creeks, Inlets, and good Havens; and amongſt theſe Thorſe-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Stromoe is the moſt conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The Air being pretty wholſom, and the Inhabitants uſing always one Diet, here are uſually found Folks that live to a great Age, as 80, or 90, ſome 100 years and above. My Author makes mention of one Eraſmus, who lived in Harold Sound in the Northern Iſlands. This Man, having got no Iſſue by his firſt Wife, and deſiring to leave an Heir of his Body, marry'd again, he being then about ninety Years old. He marry'd a young Woman, by whom he got five Children, and he was 103 years old when he got the laſt. Neither is the thing liable to Suſpicion, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Wife was a Woman of very good
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30793:79"/>Repute, and that would not impoſe upon him. At laſt he died, 110 years old.</p>
               <p>Though this Country lies all upon the Sea, yet it is ſo far from being troubled with <hi>Agues,</hi> that ſome who had it, and could not be quit of it in other Places, loſt it by coming hither, without uſing any Medicine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Children troubled here with the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> except it be brought hither from Foreign Parts. 'Tis true this Country, as well as others, has its particular Diſcaſes.</p>
               <p>In the Spring and after Harveſt, they are generally affected with a <hi>ſtrong Rhume,</hi> that makes them cough and ſpit, and cauſes ſuch an Head-ach and pain in the Limbs, that many are bedrid with it, and ſome dye of it. Againſt this Sickneſs, which doubtleſs proceeds from a cold and moiſt Air, they drink ſowr Whey as hot as they can ſuffer it. This Sickneſs, when they come off well, does them a great deal of good; purging (as it does) the Body of all Impurity, contracted by the cold moiſture of the Air, which might cauſe otherwiſe more dangerous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes.</p>
               <p>They are alſo ſometimes troubled with a <hi>Hot Sickneſs,</hi> cauſing acute Pains in the Head and Diſtractions, with Flux of the Belly, which carries off a great many People.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scurvey</hi> is a Diſcaſe this People is alſo ſubject to, who cure themſelves uſually with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30793:80"/>new Milk boiled with Scurvy-graſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with new Milk alone.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Leproſy,</hi> the next Kin to Scurvey, is the worſt and naſtieſt of all their Diſeaſes. Now Phyſicians reckon three ſorts of Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, viz. <hi>Tyria, Alopecia,</hi> and <hi>Elephantiaſis.</hi> In the firſt the Patients Skin is ſoft, with many Spots and white Warts thereon, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls off in Shells. Thoſe that are infected with the ſecond have a red Face, and their Beards and Eye-brows fall off. The third ſort is that which the People of Feroe are troubled with.</p>
               <p>And this is called <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi> from the Elephant, to whom they grow like in their Skin. The Face and Limbs of almoſt all the Infected are full of blew Knobs, that break out ſometimes as boils, which deforms them ſtrangely. They are hoarſe beſides, and ſpeak through their Noſes. This Sickneſs takes them moſt in the Spring and Fall, and then many dye of it. The ſame is cauſed as the Scurvy, by the Rawneſs of the Air; but eſpecially by the wretched Diet of the poorer ſort of People, who eat Fleſh and Fiſh half rotten, and freſh Fiſh without any Salt. Whereby the Blood being corrupted, the Sickneſs gnaws it ſelf a great while through the Body, till at laſt it breaks out. So that many People are infected with this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſeaſe long before they ſeem to be ſo;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30793:80"/>and many do marry together, thinking to be clean on both ſides, when afterwards one of them is found to be infected. But 'tis very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that this Diſeaſe (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo catching in Converſation) is not ſo amongſt marry'd People, where one would think it ſhould be moſt contagious. Nay, it has been frequently ſeen, that the Children of leprous Women, or of healthful Women marry'd to leprous Husbands, have been free from that Uncleanneſs. Which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe People in their Wooing take no great care whether the Parents have been clear or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flannel</hi> is the common Wear here. And, inſtead of Beds, they lye on nothing but Hay, with a piece of Flannel ſpread over it.</p>
               <p>They are pretty laborious and induſtrious withall, not inclined either to idle Paſtimes or ſcandalous Plays. In their Weddings indeed, and at Chriſtmas, they divertiſe themſelves with Dancing, and ſinging of ſome old Champions Ballad. And at their vacant Hours they love to play at Cheſs; wherein many, both Men and Women, are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert. They are by Nature ſomething encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Aſtronomy, and will not eaſily be weaned from their old Cuſtoms, good or bad. Their <hi>Language</hi> is that of Norway, but mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Daniſh Words.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:30793:81"/>
               <p>As their Predeceſſors, together with thoſe of Iſeland, Schetland, and the Orcades, uſed to ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the Kings of Norway, ſo they have done the like to the Kings of Denmark, ſince they got the Crown of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They have no particular Laws, as in Iſcland, but govern themſelves after the Law of Norway. And, as they got their Laws from Norway, ſo from thence they got their <hi>Religion.</hi> For here they are Lutherans, as in Norway.</p>
               <p>There are in all but thirty nine <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> and thoſe but little Churches nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, commonly built with Norway-deals, and without covered with Stones. As their Congregations lye very much ſcattered from each other, ſo their Miniſters have a great deal of Pains, and undergo great Dangers in Winter. The Churches that are far remote on the little Iſlands cannot always be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe of Storms and bad Weather. So that the Parſons of thoſe Places viſit their Congregations but once in five or ſix Weeks, as the Seaſon of the Year will give them leave. The Parſon of great Dimen goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but in the Summer; and, when he comes there, ſuch is the nature of the Iſland all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Clifts, that he muſt be drawn up and let down with a Rope.</p>

               <head>Of Iſeland, Greenland, New Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THeſe three Countrys, all of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the King of Denmark for their Sovereign, lye towards the North-Pole. The firſt, within the Arctick Circle, is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Europe; the ſecond, in <hi>Terra Polaris Arctica;</hi> the third, in the Northern Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſeland</hi> is a great Iſland, about 60 Leagues North-weſt of the Iſles of Feroe, and 180 Weſt of Norway. The Arctick Circle runs almoſt through the very middle. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iſeland,</hi> quaſi <hi>Iceland,</hi> from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Ice in it and about it, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually frozen for the ſpace of eight months. And indeed, it is ſo vehemently chilled with the Northern Winds, that it yields neither Corn, nor Trees, except Juniper. Yet there is Graſs in ſuch abundance, eſpecially along the Sea-coaſt, that the People ſometimes keep their Cartel from feeding, for fear of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit. Whereas the Inland Parts are but hilly, and batren.</p>
               <p>The Length of the Iſland from Eaſt to Weſt is 130 Leagues; and its Breadth from North to South, 60. It is divided, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Quarters of the World, into four
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30793:82"/>Parts; viz. North, South, Eaſt, and Weſt Iſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Here are Horſes, Sheep, and Oxen; but the Oxen and Cows without Horns. Here is alſo a fine breed of little Dogs, known amongſt us by the name of Iſeland Dogs, and much like thoſe of Maltha, the delight of Ladies. This Country is likewiſe noted for its white Falcons and white Ravens, Eagles with white Tails, Hares and Bears of the ſame colour. Fiſh is the Staple commodity of the Country, of which here is great plenty, and that of the beſt ſort; a piece of Iſeland Ling being count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us a Noble Diſh.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the cold Condition of this Iſland, yet it burns within in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and is full of Fire under ground. For there are three Mountains, whoſe Tops are always covered with Snow, and yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burning. The principal whereof is <hi>Hecla.</hi> Which (like the Sicilian Aetna) doth vomit out dreadful flames; then black Aſhes and Pumice-ſtones, in ſo great abundance, that it darkneth the Sun, and makes the Country for ſix miles round about it to be uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And, as the groſs Papiſts take Mount Aetna to be the Place of Purgatory, ſo the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious amongſt the People of Iſeland fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Hell to be under their flaming Mountain. Whereas to Judicious men the natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe Flames are plain and obvious,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:30793:82"/>being occaſioned by thoſe Veins of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, on which the foundation of the Hill is laid.</p>
               <p>And indeed here is found ſo much of that Mineral, that a vaſt quantity thereof is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from thence into Foreign Parts. Here are alſo many Baths and Fountains of hot Water, which have Sulphur ſwimming at the top. And Moreri tells us of a Lake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that petrifies whatever is caſt in it.</p>
               <p>This Iſland has been generally conceived to be that <hi>Thule,</hi> which the Poets ſo often ſpeak of. But I ſhould rather conceive it to be Schetland, for the Reaſons I brought (page 113.) when I ſpoke of that Iſland.</p>
               <p>At the firſt Planting of Iſeland, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not trouble themſelves with building Towns; but every one ſeated himſelf where he thought convenient, dwelling in Cells and Caverns digged in the bottom of the Rocks, near the Sea, for the conveniency of fiſhing. And to this very day the In-land Parts have not many Houſes. Whereas the Sea-coaſts are grown pretty Populous, ſince the coming of ſo many Strangers. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the Havens of Hanefiord and Keplawick, whereto the Danes, Engliſh, and Dutch, do commonly reſort with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. The Buildings are for the moſt part of Timber, roofed with Flags, Turfs, or Skins, and having on the ſides of the Roof
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:30793:83"/>a Hole to let in the Light. Some Houſes they make of Fiſh bones.</p>
               <p>Beſides the conveniency of Fiſhing and of Trade, they live near the Sea-ſide, becauſe there comes frequently great Flakes of Ice, that float hither from other Countrys of the North, and bring them Wood and other Commodities.</p>
               <p>They live much (as in the Golden Age) on that which Nature gives them, without any great help of Art. Only they make Cheeſe and Butter, and the common Sort cat Bread made of Flower of dry'd Fiſh. They uſe neither Phyſick nor Phyſicians, and live perhaps the longer for it. For many of them attain to the Age of 150 years, and more. The Women are handſom; but their Dreſs differs ſo little from that of the other Sex, that it is hard to diſcern the one from the other.</p>
               <p>Some ſay this Iſland was diſcovered by Gaſper, a Swede; others, by one Eric, a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegian; but when, it is not agreed. Heylin ſays, it was ſo far from being known unto the Ancients, that it was hardly known to thoſe of Norway till the Year 874. At which time King Harold I, ſuppreſſing thoſe petty Kings that were then in Norway, forced many of them to ſeek new Dwellings. Of which ſome arrived here, where they found room enough to plant in, and no great loſs (if any) by the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:30793:83"/>change of their Dwelling. Upon their Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they were followed afterwards by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Friends and Countrymen, till at laſt the Fiſhing Trade drew thither a great many Strangers, eſpecially from Denmark, England, Holland, and the Hanſe-Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hola</hi> in the North, and <hi>Scalholt</hi> in the South, both Biſhops Sees, are the two chief Places of this Iſland. <hi>Beſtede</hi> is a Caſtle, where the Governour makes his Reſidence.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two Epiſcopal Sees were founded by the perſuaſion and procurement of Adelbert, Arch-biſhop of Bremen, by whoſe means the People of this Iſland were firſt converted to the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Anno</hi> 1070. And to thoſe two Biſhops Sees were added, in tract of time, eight Religious Houſes. But ſince this Iſland was brought under the Crown of Norway, that is in the Year 1260, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fortunes of it, in all Changes both of Church and State. It was made ſubject with it to the Kings of Denmark, and reformed together with it in Matters of Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Confeſſion of Augsburg. Then the Biſhops were reformed into Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and the Revenues of Monaſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into other Uſes, according to the Will and Pleaſure of their Lords of Denmark.</p>
               <p>North and Weſt of Iſeland lies <hi>Groenland, in Terra Polaris Arctica.</hi> A vaſt Tract of Land,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:30793:84"/>at leaſt the Sea-coaſts thereof. Which being all that is diſcovered of it hitherto, leaves us in doubt whether it is an Iſland or Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. It is called <hi>Groenland,</hi> or <hi>Greenland,</hi> from the Greenneſs of it in Summer-time, that is in June, July, and Auguſt. During which time, the Inhabitants in the moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of it have no Night at all. And yet they ſcarce feel any heat; which makes them go in Furs and Skins all the year round.</p>
               <p>This Country was firſt diſcovered, ſays Baudrand, by one Eric the Red-haired, a Norvegian, <hi>Anno</hi> 982. Who having thus made way for his Countrymen, they and the Danes followed him thither. So that this Countrey (at leaſt the Sea-coaſts thereof) became Tributary to the Crown of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>
               <p>The moſt Southern Parts of it were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered by Forbiſher, Davis, and Baffin. But as yet we have no account of the Inland Parts. So that all I have to ſay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Unknown Land is, that Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing has made it more famous than any thing elſe. To which purpoſe this Country is much frequented by the two greateſt Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring Nations in the World, the Engliſh and Hollanders.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:30793:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>New Denmark</hi> is a Country that lyes in the North-weſt Parts of the Northern America; and that was diſcovered by Munk a Dane, in the Reign of Chriſtiern the Fourth. Its Diſcovery, Name, and Situation is all that I can hear of.</p>
               <p>In Africk, upon the Coaſt of Guinea, the King of Denmark has a Place called <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixburg,</hi> fortify'd with a Caſtle. It lies near Cabo Corſo, and S. Georgio della Mina. In Aſia likewiſe the Danes have their Colonies; and, before the late Troubles of Bantam in Java, there they had a Factory.</p>
